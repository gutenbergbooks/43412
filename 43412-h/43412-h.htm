      MOZART and his mother<span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p001.png">[1]</a></span>
      left Mannheim on March 14, and arrived in Paris on the 23rd, after a
      journey of nine days and a-half. "We thought we should never get through
      it," writes Wolfgang (March 24, 1778), <a href="#linknote-1801"
      name="linknoteref-1801" id="linknoteref-1801"> 1 </a> "and I never in my
      life was so tired. You can imagine what it was to leave Mannheim and all
      our dear, good friends there, and to be obliged to exist for ten days
      without a single soul even to speak to. God be praised, however, we are
      now at our journey's end. I am in hopes that, with His help, all will go
      well. To-day we mean to take a fiacre and go to call on Grimm and
      Wendling. Early to-morrow I shall go to the Electoral Minister Herr von
      Sickingen, who is a great connoisseur and lover of music, and to whom I
      have letters of introduction from Herr von Gemmingen and Herr Cannabich."
      L. Mozart was full of hope concerning this visit to Paris, and believed
      that Wolfgang could not fail to gain fame and, as a consequence, money in
      the French capital. He remembered the brilliant reception which had been
      given to him and his children fourteen years before, and he was convinced
      that a like support would be accorded to the youth who had fulfilled his
      early promise to a degree that to an intelligent observer must appear even
      more wonderful than his precocious performances as a child. He counted
      upon the support and assistance of many distinguished and influential
      persons, whose favour they had already experienced, and more especially on
      the tried friendship of Grimm, who had formerly given them the benefit of
      all his knowledge and power, and with whom they had continued in
      connection ever since. Grimm had lately passed through Salzburg with two
      <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p002.png">[2]</a></span> friends, and was pleased to hear
      his "Amadeo," as he called Wolfgang. He chanced to arrive at Augsburg on
      the evening of Wolfgang's concert there, and was present at it without
      making himself known, since he was in haste, and had heard that Wolfgang
      was on his way to Paris. L. Mozart, who placed great confidence in Grimm's
      friendship and experience, had made no secret to him of his precarious
      position in Salzburg, and of how greatly Wolfgang was in need of support;
      he commended his son entirely to Grimm's favour (April 6, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend you most emphatically to endeavour by childlike confidence to
      merit, or rather to preserve, the favour, love, and friendship of the
      Baron von Grimm; to take counsel with him on every point, and to do
      nothing hastily or from impulse; in all things be careful of your own
      interests, which are those of us all. Life in Paris is very different from
      life in Germany, and the French ways of expressing oneself politely, of
      introducing oneself, of craving patronage, &amp;c., are quite peculiar; so
      much so, that Baron von Grimm used always to instruct me as to what I
      should say, and how I should express myself. Be sure you tell him, with my
      best compliments, that I have reminded you of this, and he will tell you
      that I am right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, clever as he was, L. Mozart had miscalculated on several points. He
      did not reflect that Grimm had grown older, more indolent, and more
      stately, and that even formerly a tact and obsequiousness had been
      required in order to turn the great man's friendship to account, which,
      natural as they were to himself, his son never did and never would
      acquire. He had not sufficiently realised that the attention of the public
      is far more easily attracted by what is strange and wonderful, than by the
      greatest intellectual and artistic endowments. This was peculiarly the
      case in Paris, where interest in musical performances only mounted to
      enthusiasm when some unusual circumstance accompanied them. True, such
      enthusiasm was at its height at the time of Mozart's visit, but his father
      could not see that this very fact was against a young man who had so
      little of the art of ingratiating himself with others. To us it must ever
      appear as an extraordinary coincidence that Mozart, fresh from Mannheim,
      and the efforts there being made for the establishment of a national
      German opera, should have come to Paris at <span class="side">LULLY,
      1652-1687.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p003.png">[3]</a></span>
      the very height of the struggle between Italian opera and the French
      opera, as reformed by Gluck, a struggle which appeared to be on the point
      of being fought out. In neither case did his strong feelings on the
      subject tempt him to take an active part; he maintained the attitude of a
      neutral observer, in preparation for the tasks to which he might be
      appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are clearly to apprehend the musical situation, we must remind
      ourselves in order of the circumstances which had brought it about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Baptiste de Lully (1633-1687), a native of Florence, had gained such
      distinction by his violin-playing and ballet music, that in 1652 he was
      appointed kapellmeister by Louis XIV., and in 1672 he received full power
      to establish and direct the AcadÃ©mie Royale de Musique. Not only was he
      the founder of this still existing institution,* but he established by its
      means the grand opera in France. Faithful to the traditions of his
      birthplace, Florence, he kept in view the first attempts which had been
      made in Italy to revive ancient tragedy in opera (Vol. I., p. 154 et
      seq.). As in Italy, so in Paris, operatic performances were originally
      designed for court festivals; Lully's privilege consisted in his being
      allowed to give public representations of operas, "even of those which had
      been produced at court" ("mÃªme celles qui auront Ã©tÃ© reprÃ©sentÃ©s devant
      Nous "). They were preceded by ballets, in which the connection of the
      action was indicated by vocal scenes; but the singing was quite
      subordinate to the long succession of dances, in which the distinguished
      part of the audience, and even the king himself, took part. Dances,
      therefore, became an essential ingredient of the opera, and it was the
      task of the poet and the composers to give them appropriate connection
      with the plot; to this day, as is well known, the ballet is the special
      prerogative of the Grand-OpÃ©ra at Paris. It was not less important to
      maintain the reputation of the most brilliant court in the <span
      class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p004.png">[4]</a></span> world by means of variety and
      magnificence of scenery, costumes, machinery, &amp;c.; in this respect,
      also, the Grand-OpÃ©ra has kept true to its traditions.<a
      href="#linknote-1802" name="linknoteref-1802" id="linknoteref-1802"> 2
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But whilst in Italy the musical, and especially the vocal, element of the
      opera had always the upper hand, in Paris the dramatic element held its
      ground with good success. It was the easier for Lully to found a national
      opera in Paris, since he found a poet ready to hand in Quinault, who had
      the genius to clothe his mythological subjects in the dramatic and
      poetical dress of his own day. To us, indeed, his productions seem far
      apart from the spirit of ancient tragedy, and more rhetorical and
      epigrammatic than poetical in their conception. But his operas (or rather
      tragedies) expressed truly the spirit of the age, and they became more
      distinctively national in proportion as the reign of Louis XIV. came to be
      considered as the golden age of France. It was Lully's task to give
      musical expression to the national spirit, and in this he succeeded to the
      admiration of his contemporaries and of posterity. His music is closely
      connected' with those first attempts in Italy. We find none of the set
      forms of the later opera seria, no regular arie, no duets, no ensembles.
      The words are for the most part simply rendered in recitative. There is
      sometimes a figured bass accompaniment; but even then it is not the free
      movement of Italian recitative, but is much more precisely apportioned,
      and the harmonies of the accompaniment change more frequently. When the
      sentiment becomes rather more elevated, a sort of compromise is effected
      between recitative and song. The words are rendered with a declamatory
      spoken accent; and not only are they strictly in time, but the harmonies
      are so arranged that a full orchestral chord is given to every note of the
      song. The melodies are therefore limited in every respect; the phrases are
      generally too small in compass to be well carried out, and hang loosely
      together without any proper design; it was difficult to develop an
      elaborate musical form out of such elements as these. Independent songs
      occur seldom, and then only in the most precise of forms, tending
      generally to dance melodies (airs). When several voices unite they
      alternate with each other; or if they <span class="side">LULLY'S OPERAS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p005.png">[5]</a></span> sing
      together note follows note, with only exceptionally real ensemble
      passages. The choruses are formed by a simple harmony in several parts,
      the soprano not being always appointed to give the melody. The orchestra,
      except in the dance music, has seldom any independent significance, but
      simply gives the full harmony to every note of the bass. Instrumental
      effect is seldom aimed at, and the different instruments are only
      occasionally employed singly. Lully's merit chiefly consists in his having
      accentuated his music in a manner which suited the French language, and
      also in his having succeeded in throwing a certain amount of
      characteristic pathos into some of his passages. It is comprehensible that
      at first, musical cultivation being in its infancy, this quality should be
      most readily felt and acknowledged; but in every art, and especially in
      music, it is the fate of individual characteristics to become the soonest
      incomprehensible, and, therefore, unpleasing. For this reason, the
      reaction against Lully's music attacked just this mode of treating the
      text. It was considered monotonous, tiresome, and heavy; and the isolated
      significant phrases having lost their power to please, were compared with
      the plain-song (plain-chant) of church psalmody.<a href="#linknote-1803"
      name="linknoteref-1803" id="linknoteref-1803"> 3 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The delivery of the vocalists, male and female, is described as dreadful;
      monotonous droning alternating with violent shrieks and exaggerated accent
      (<i>urlo francese</i>).<a href="#linknote-1804" name="linknoteref-1804"
      id="linknoteref-1804"> 4 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all this, Lully's operas held undisputed possession of the
      stage during his life,<a href="#linknote-1805" name="linknoteref-1805"
      id="linknoteref-1805"> 5 </a> and even after his death, a sure proof that
      his success was not merely the result of the favour personally accorded to
      him. The composers whose operas found favour after his (such as Campra,
      Colasse, Desmarets, Blamont, and Mouret) are of less <span class="side">FRENCH
      OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p006.png">[6]</a></span>
      importance historically, because they all copied his manner. Any part of
      their works which pointed to the influence of the opera seria, as it was
      being formed in the Neapolitan school, was rejected by the national
      vanity.<a href="#linknote-1806" name="linknoteref-1806"
      id="linknoteref-1806"> 6 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Phil. Rameau (1683-1764) came to Paris from the provinces as an
      established musician in 1721. He succeeded by his force of character, and
      the powerful protection of the Farmer-General, La PopeliniÃ¨re, in placing
      his operas on a level with those of Lully in the public estimation. When
      he produced his "Hippolyte et Aricie" in 1732, he was met by the most
      determined opposition on the part of Lully's supporters; but the very
      decided success of his acknowledged masterpiece, "Castor et Pollux," in
      1737,<a href="#linknote-1807" name="linknoteref-1807" id="linknoteref-1807">
      7 </a> placed him, if not above Lully, certainly on an equality with him
      during the remainder of his career. His opponents became gradually
      reconciled to his supremacy, and acknowledged that French music had not
      been essentially altered by Rameau, only developed and perfected.<a
      href="#linknote-1808" name="linknoteref-1808" id="linknoteref-1808"> 8
      </a> And there can be no question that this was the case. Before Rameau
      had produced any operas he had made his reputation as an organist and
      instrumental composer, and more especially as the founder of a theory of
      harmony. On this latter point his operas also show considerable progress&mdash;the
      harmonic treatment is rich and varied, though sometimes the straining
      after novelty and effect <span class="side">RAMEAU, 1732-1764.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p007.png">[7]</a></span> leads to
      affectation and over-elaboration. Rameau's accompaniments are free and
      independent; the orchestra is used with striking effect by means of
      variety of tone-colour-ing in the instruments as well as of independent
      subjects, which serve to accent the details. Rameau's employment of the
      orchestra shows a marked improvement, not only on Lully, but even on
      Italian opera as then existing. In the same way we find the choruses
      released from the fetters of strict thorough-bass, and the parts moving
      freely and expressively. In the lyrical portions of the opera, much is
      evidently due to the advance in the art of solo singing, both rhythm and
      melody move more freely, and embellishment is not wholly wanting. But
      Rameau has not avowedly adopted the Italian style, although he spent a
      short part of his youth in Italy. The accepted forms of Italian opera are
      entirely disregarded, both in the choruses and solos. The slow, uniform
      progress of Lully's operas becomes freer and more animated in Rameau's,
      the dramatic expression has more energy and life, and the music has more
      of individual colouring; but the foundation remains. The same is the case
      with the treatment of the dialogue. It is still severe, stately,
      recitative-like singing in varied measure, but Rameau's harmonic art is
      displayed in his incomparably greater power of expression. Rameau's opera,
      notwithstanding its independent invention and advance in artistic feeling,
      is the natural development of Lully's principles, not a revolution against
      them. It was debated at the time with much warmth whether Rameau's
      peculiarities were to be accepted as improvements, or to be looked upon as
      injudicious attempts at novelty. The points which then excited the
      liveliest interest now seem to us most trivial. But the main fact is not
      to be denied, that Rameau, by the efforts of his own genius, constructed a
      national French opera upon the foundations laid by Lully, and that the
      further development of the grand opera proceeded along, the lines laid
      down by him. Not only can the framework and design of these early operas
      be recognised in the grand opera of the present day, but French dramatic
      music, spite of many transformations, betrays its relationship with the
      early masters in many <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p008.png">[8]</a></span> peculiarities
      of melody, rhythm and harmony; a sure proof that national feeling lies at
      the root of the traditions.

    <p>
      The well-wishers of the national French opera were right in settling their
      disputes about Lully and Rameau by the recognition of them both; for both
      alike were threatened by a formidable irruption of Italian taste, which
      now so completely governed the remainder of Europe that France could not
      fail to be in some measure affected by it. In August, 1752, a company of
      Italian singers came to Paris under the direction of a certain Bambini,
      and having received permission to represent comic operas (intermezzi) in
      the hall of the Grand OpÃ©ra, were called "Les Bouffons."<a
      href="#linknote-1809" name="linknoteref-1809" id="linknoteref-1809"> 9
      </a> Their first representation of Pergolese's "Serva Padrona" was a
      failure, but subsequently it was applauded with enthusiasm. The chief
      singers of the company, Manelli and Anna Tonelli, were highly esteemed
      both for their singing and acting, although they did not reach to the
      highest level of Italian opera; the others were indifferent.<a
      href="#linknote-18010" name="linknoteref-18010" id="linknoteref-18010"> 10
      </a> But they were Italian throats, Italian ways of singing and acting
      which lent all their powers to the interpretation of opera buffa, with its
      polished, pleasing form, simply and easily grasped harmonies, and
      sustained melodies. They found in Paris an appreciative audience, and very
      soon even the Parisian orchestra, where the conductor beat time audibly,<a
      href="#linknote-18011" name="linknoteref-18011" id="linknoteref-18011"> 11
      </a> while the Italian conductor only directed from the clavier, was
      described, in comparison to the Italian, as a company of uneducated
      musicians whose great aim was to make as much noise as possible. The
      supporters of the national school of music naturally took up arms against
      the <span class="side">LES BOUFFONS, 1752.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p009.png">[9]</a></span> Italian enthusiasts, and so arose
      the well-known struggle between the "coin du roi" (nationalists) and the
      "coin de la reine" (Italians).<a href="#linknote-18012"

      Grimm, who always manifested great interest in musical matters, had become
      acquainted with Italian opera in Germany, and afterwards in Paris, where
      he took up his abode in 1749; his intercourse with Rousseau and other
      sympathetic friends increased his partiality for it. His burlesque of "Le
      Petit ProphÃ¨te de Boehmischbroda" (1753), which foretold in the biblical
      prophetic style the downfall of good taste if Paris were not converted to
      Italian music,<a href="#linknote-18013" name="linknoteref-18013"
      id="linknoteref-18013"> 13 </a> proved a powerful ally to Italian music;
      he was joined by Diderot, who, like all the encyclopedists, was personally
      antagonistic to Rameau on account of his attack on the "EncyclopÃ©die."<a
      href="#linknote-18014" name="linknoteref-18014" id="linknoteref-18014"> 14
      </a> Jean Jacques Rousseau, who in his "Devin du Village" had shown the
      delighted public how far the treasures of the Italian opera could be
      turned to good account in the French (Vol. I., p. 87 et seq.), threw all
      the weight of his influence into the scale of the Bouffonists; not content
      with mercilessly exposing the shortcomings of the French opera, he
      undertook to prove that the French language was unfitted for composition,
      and French music altogether an impossibility.<a href="#linknote-18015"
      name="linknoteref-18015" id="linknoteref-18015"> 15 </a> The enraged

      It may well be wondered at that men like Rousseau<a href="#linknote-18019"
      name="linknoteref-18019" id="linknoteref-18019"> 19 </a> and Diderot,<a
      href="#linknote-18020" name="linknoteref-18020" id="linknoteref-18020"> 20
      </a> who upheld simplicity and nature as the true canons of art, should
      have evinced a preference for Italian music. For though doubtless the
      Italian style was grounded originally on the nature of music, it had
      already become conventional, and far removed from what the philosophers
      called natural. At the same time it must be remembered that their
      partiality always turned in the direction of opera buffa, which sought
      from its commencement to free itself from the conventional restraint of
      opera seria (Vol. I., p. 203). Then, too, the musical element, as
      distinguished from the poetical or dramatic, had always been the
      foundation of Italian opera, and an opposition directed against the French
      opera, with its poetical and dramatic proclivities, would be sure to
      uphold the purely musical development of the Italians, even though the
      exaggerations into which it was carried might be displeasing to the
      philosophers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the Bouffons survived their departure. The ComÃ©die
      Italienne (aux Italiens) produced Italian comedies in masquerade, French
      comedies, and parodies of qperas, the charm of which consisted mainly in
      their vocal parts, on which account they were called opÃ©ras comiques.<a
      href="#linknote-18021" name="linknoteref-18021" id="linknoteref-18021"> 21
      </a> A dangerous rival to the ComÃ©die Italienne was the ThÃ©Ã¤tre de la
      Foire, whose representations took place originally on <span class="side">OPÃ‰RA
      COMIQUE&mdash;DUNI, 1757-1775.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p011.png">[11]</a></span> the Feasts of St. Germain, St.
      Laurent, and St. Ovide. The two companies were always inimical, and the
      "ComÃ©diens de la Foire" were from time to time suppressed by their
      stronger rival,<a href="#linknote-18022" name="linknoteref-18022"
      id="linknoteref-18022"> 22 </a> but always revived, until at last in 1762
      the two companies were amalgamated.<a href="#linknote-18023"
      name="linknoteref-18023" id="linknoteref-18023"> 23 </a> In this soil was
      planted opera buffa, and, favoured by circumstances, it grew into a great
      national institution.<a href="#linknote-18024" name="linknoteref-18024"
      id="linknoteref-18024"> 24 </a> Translations and adaptations of favourite
      Italian operas satisfied the public at first, and were decried by the
      Bouffonists as travesties of the original.<a href="#linknote-18025"
      name="linknoteref-18025" id="linknoteref-18025"> 25 </a> But very soon,
      especially after the brilliant success of Vade's "Les Troqueurs" in 1753,
      a new school of composers sought to reconcile the excellencies of the
      Italian music, especially in singing, with the exigencies of the national
      taste. It was difficult at first to break loose from the defined outline
      and simple design of the intermezzi, but gradually the French taste became
      apparent in the greater connection and interest of the plot, and the
      delicacy and wit of the composition. The lively interest of the public
      induced poets of talent, such as Favart, Sedaine, and Marmontel, to devote
      themselves to operatic writing, and the French comic opera soon surpassed
      the opera buffa, from a dramatic as well as a musical point of view. These
      various impulses were all the more lasting since they were founded on the
      national character.<a href="#linknote-18026" name="linknoteref-18026"
      id="linknoteref-18026"> 26 </a>

      Egidio Romoaldo Duni (1709-1775), born and educated in Naples, having made
      his reputation on the Italian stage, was led by his connection with the
      court at Parma, which was French in manners and in taste, to compose
      French operettas, as, for instance, "Ninette Ã¤ la Cour." The applause with
      which they were received induced him to go to Paris in 1757, where he made
      an exceptionally favourable dÃ©but with the "Peintre Amoureux," and during
      the next <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p012.png">[12]</a></span> thirteen years produced a
      succession of comic operas, the easy style and simple form of which
      secured them both the favour of the public and the imitation of untrained
      French composers.<a href="#linknote-18027" name="linknoteref-18027"
      id="linknoteref-18027"> 27 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Duni was followed by Pierre Alex. Monsigny (1729-1817),<a
      href="#linknote-18028" name="linknoteref-18028" id="linknoteref-18028"> 28
      </a> a dilettante, who was so excited by the performances of the Bouffons
      that he applied himself to the study of music, and at once began to
      compose operas. In 1759 he put his first opera, "Les Aveux Indiscrets," on
      the stage, and this was rapidly succeeded by others. Sedaine was so
      interested in Monsigny that he intrusted all his operatic librettos to
      him.<a href="#linknote-18029" name="linknoteref-18029"
      id="linknoteref-18029"> 29 </a> A wider sphere was opened to him with the
      three-act opera, "Le Roi et le Fermier," which was the commencement of the
      most brilliant success. It must be allowed that the co-operation of a poet
      to whom even Grimm allows all the qualities of a good librettist<a
      href="#linknote-18030" name="linknoteref-18030" id="linknoteref-18030"> 30
      </a> was an important element in this success; but Monsigny's work was
      quite on a level with that of his collaborateur. His music expresses with
      instinctive truth the most amiable side of the French character. Monsigny
      not only had at his command a wealth of pleasing sympathetic melodies, but
      possessed as decided a talent for pathos as for light comedy, and a sure
      perception of dramatic effect, combined with life, delicacy, and grace.
      His natural feeling for beauty of form concealed the want of thorough
      artistic training,<a href="#linknote-18031" name="linknoteref-18031"
      id="linknoteref-18031"> 31 </a> and his operas were universally admired,
      some of them, such as "Le DÃ©serteur,"<a href="#linknote-18032"
      name="linknoteref-18032" id="linknoteref-18032"> 32 </a> acquiring more
      extended fame.

    <p>
      A better theoretical musician was FranÃ§. AndrÃ© (Danican) Philidor
      (1727-1795), who enjoyed the reputation of extraordinary genius as a
      chess-player before appearing as a composer with his first opera, "Blaise
      le Savetier," in 1759.<a href="#linknote-18033" name="linknoteref-18033"
      id="linknoteref-18033"> 33 </a> His fame as a musician was soon
      established, and he ruled the comic stage with Duni and Monsigny until
      GrÃ©try took possession of it. He was reproached with justice for too great
      a display of musical scholarship, and for making his accompaniments too
      prominent.<a href="#linknote-18034" name="linknoteref-18034"
      id="linknoteref-18034"> 34 </a> He had more force and energy than
      Monsigny, with greater power of passionate expression, but his fun is
      coarser, and he is inferior in grace and tenderness. He finally abandoned
      music, partly from disinclination to enter into rivalry with GrÃ©try, and
      partly from his passion for chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic that comic opera, the outcome of vaudeville and
      chanson, should have been nursed in its infancy by composers like Duni,
      who had no pretensions to great genius, Monsigny, who was half a
      dilettante, and Philidor, who only composed music as a pastime. AndrÃ© Ern.
      GrÃ©try, on the contrary (1741-1813), threw himself into the pursuit with
      all his powers, and with zealous ardour. He it was who perfected the comic
      opera, making it, what it still remains, the representative of the French
      national character in the province of dramatic music. As a boy, he had
      delighted in the performances of Italian opera singers in his native town
      of LiÃ¨ge, and as a youth he had been in Rome during the most brilliant
      part of Piccinni's career, had studied there for several years, and at
      last produced an intermezzo, "Le Vin-demiatrici," which was well received,
      and gained even Pic-cinni's approval. In Paris, although Monsigny and
      Philidor received him kindly, he had to contend with difficulties; but
      <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p014.png">[14]</a></span> after the complete success of his
      opera "Le Huron," in 1768,<a href="#linknote-18035"
      name="linknoteref-18035" id="linknoteref-18035"> 35 </a> even his
      remarkable fertility in production could hardly satisfy the demands of the
      public for his works. Marmontel, Sedaine, and other poets offered him
      libretti which were in themselves pledges of success. The idea that
      dramatic poetry should represent human nature in its naked reality, which
      had emanated from the encyclopedists, found its realisation in the drama
      of common life, and had considerable influence on the development of the
      comic opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strict line of demarcation between opera seria and buffa did not exist
      in Paris. The effort to give more dramatic interest and freer scope to
      operatic music led to the portrayal of the deeper and noble emotions, and
      opera approached more and more nearly to serious comedy in plot,
      situations, and psychological intention. Merriment gradually ceased to be
      the predominating element, and became nothing more than a flavouring
      thrown in; it was replaced by that mixture of seriousness and playfulness
      which, in opposition to the former prohibition of any amalgamation of
      different styles, was now considered as the true expression of music.<a
      href="#linknote-18036" name="linknoteref-18036" id="linknoteref-18036"> 36
      </a> A characteristic distinction between comic and serious opera in
      France was the adoption by the former of spoken dialogue instead of
      recitative.<a href="#linknote-18037" name="linknoteref-18037"
      id="linknoteref-18037"> 37 </a> Any attempt to imitate the free,
      declamatory recitative of the Italians would have been thought too daring,
      and was perhaps actually prohibited by the privileges of the Grand-OpÃ©ra.
      But in renouncing recitative, the dialogue gained the freedom of witty and
      sparkling conversation, without which the French cannot exist; and this
      note, once struck, soon regulated the whole character of <span class="side">GRÃŠTRY.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p015.png">[15]</a></span> operatic
      music, which, elevated as it may be, nevertheless starts from the idea of
      a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could be better fitted than GrÃ©try for the development of such a
      style as this.<a href="#linknote-18038" name="linknoteref-18038"
      id="linknoteref-18038"> 38 </a> His was a pliant and amiable nature, but
      not a great one. He was excitable and susceptible to any emotion, but
      without depth; his wit was delicate and versatile, and he possessed the
      power of giving it the most striking and appropriate expression. He was
      determined that his music should always faithfully render some definite
      emotion, even to the minutest detail of the dramatic situation and
      characters. He held that a composer could only attain this end by working
      himself up into a pitch of intense excitement,<a href="#linknote-18039"
      name="linknoteref-18039" id="linknoteref-18039"> 39 </a> and living for
      the time in the drama that was under his hands.<a href="#linknote-18040"
      name="linknoteref-18040" id="linknoteref-18040"> 40 </a> The actual means
      which he employed was song, that is, melody. He learnt the art of tuneful
      song from the Italians,<a href="#linknote-18041" name="linknoteref-18041"
      id="linknoteref-18041"> 41 </a> and made its expressiveness depend upon
      intonation in delivery, which it is the composer's part to suggest and
      control.<a href="#linknote-18042" name="linknoteref-18042"
      id="linknoteref-18042"> 42 </a> He laid great stress upon true and
      strongly accentuated declamation,<a href="#linknote-18043"
      name="linknoteref-18043" id="linknoteref-18043"> 43 </a> which he had
      studied under good actors.<a href="#linknote-18044"
      name="linknoteref-18044" id="linknoteref-18044"> 44 </a> This lent a
      liveliness and piquancy to his musical style,<a href="#linknote-18045"
      name="linknoteref-18045" id="linknoteref-18045"> 45 </a> and rendered it
      essentially French.<a href="#linknote-18046" name="linknoteref-18046"

      GrÃ©try accomplished wonders for musical form, as far as grace and
      freshness, lively emotion and wit go, but his powers did not attain to
      anything truly great or important to art. The art of melodious expression
      was developed by him almost to the exclusion of other means, such as rich
      and well-chosen hÃ¤rmonies,<a href="#linknote-18047"
      name="linknoteref-18047" id="linknoteref-18047"> 47 </a> artistic
      accompaniments, and instrumental effects, all of which he treated as
      subordinate and unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inveighs against the misuse of the instruments, especially of the wind
      instruments, which Gluck's example had introduced, even if he were not
      personally responsible for it;<a href="#linknote-18048"
      name="linknoteref-18048" id="linknoteref-18048"> 48 </a> but he recommends
      the moderate use of them for characterisation,<a href="#linknote-18049"
      name="linknoteref-18049" id="linknoteref-18049"> 49 </a> and prides
      himself on his very questionable invention in his "Andromaque" of
      assigning special instruments to the recitatives of each principal
      character&mdash;Andromache, for instance, having always three flutes.<a
      href="#linknote-18050" name="linknoteref-18050" id="linknoteref-18050"> 50
      </a> A saying of GrÃ©try's, that in opera song is the statue, and the
      orchestra the pedestal, and that Mozart sometimes put the pedestal on the
      stage, has often been repeated. Whether this is authentic or not, the fact
      remains that GrÃ©try's neglect of the orchestra was not altogether of set
      purpose, but that this branch of artistic education was unknown to him and
      interested him as little as did the minute elaboration and hard study
      which are dear to all first-rate musicians. His idea that a musician of
      genius may spoil his inventive powers by too much study is truly comical;
      what he tells of his own studies shows how shallow they were, and his
      productions are all of a piece. On the other hand he lays great weight
      upon reflection, which does not properly concern music at all; but his
      simplicity, which almost amounted to barrenness, served to heighten his
      truly excellent qualities, and to make him the popular idol he was. It is
      quite conceivable that the encyclopedists, who were the champions of
      Italian music, should have seen in him the man who united beauty and
      melody with Italian truth and characteristic expression. Diderot wrote

      Christ. Wilh. Gluck (1714-1787), after doing good service to Italian opera
      in Italy and London, went to Vienna in 1748, and there wrote, partly for
      the Prince of Hildburg-hausen, partly and chiefly for the imperial court,
      a succession of Italian operas of no very striking originality. It was
      precisely the time when the traditional forms were becoming more and more
      conventional formulas, and when the vocal art was demanding the sacrifice
      of simplicity, nature, and truth to the whim of each virtuoso. The
      decadence of operatic music, which Metastasio bitterly laments (Vol. I.,
      p. 163), inspired Gluck with the desire to lead it back to its first
      principles. He was a man of earnest thought and strong will. The tendency
      of German literature to give dignity and importance to poetry did not pass
      by him unnoticed, and he was a warm admirer of Klopstock, whose odes he
      set to music.<a href="#linknote-18058" name="linknoteref-18058"
      id="linknoteref-18058"> 58 </a> The efforts then being made to raise the
      German stage in Vienna had an influence on him, and his own first attempts
      at reformation were greeted with loud applause by Sonnenfels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck has professed his principles of dramatic composition in the
      well-known dedication to his "Alceste." He declares his opposition to the
      abuses introduced by the vanity of singers and the servility of composers,
      by which the most beautiful and stately drama becomes the most tiresome;
      he refused to interrupt the action at a wrong time by a ritornello, to
      sacrifice expression to a run or a cadenza, to neglect the second part of
      a song when the situation demands that peculiar stress shall be laid on
      it, in obedience to the custom which requires the fourfold repetition of
      the words of the first part, or to give an ending to the song against the
      sense of the text; his overtures were to be characteristic of the drama
      which was to follow, and to prepare the minds of the spectators for it.
      His fundamental law of operatic music was its due subordination to the
      words, so that every turn in the action should be suitably expressed,
      without any superfluous adornment, just as colour gives life and
      expression to a <span class="side">CALSABIGI'S LIBRETTI.</span> <span

      professed his highest aim to be simple beauty;<a href="#linknote-18059"

      difficulties which hinder clearness, all novelties which do not proceed
      from the necessities of the situation; he set aside all rule in order to
      obtain true effects.

    <p>
      There can hardly be a doubt as to the justice of these principles in
      general, and we are only concerned with the result of their adoption on
      musical progress.<a href="#linknote-18060" name="linknoteref-18060"
      id="linknoteref-18060"> 60 </a> Our remarks on a style of music which
      professes itself the handmaid of poetry, and is content with giving the
      fittest expression to verse, must be prefaced by some notice of the poets
      who supplied the verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranieri de' Calsabigi came to Vienna in 1761, after making himself known
      by an edition of Metastasio's works, with an aesthetic introduction
      proving their perfection as tragedies and operas; he had also written
      several libretti for operas and cantatas. He had formed an idea that music
      fitted for dramatic poetry must approach as nearly as possible to natural,
      energetic declamation; for since declamation was only unperfected music,
      dramatic song could only be elaborated declamation enriched by the
      harmonies of the accompaniment. The poetry for such music must be intense,
      forcible, passionate, moving, and harmonious, and it could not fail of its
      result. Full of this idea he wrote "Orfeo," and submitted it to Count
      Durazzo; the latter wished it to be put on the stage, and recommended
      Gluck as the composer who could best carry out the intentions of the poet.
      Calsabigi declaimed his "Orfeo" repeatedly before Gluck, and noted his
      declamation in the text-book with signs which he illustrated by remarks.<a
      href="#linknote-18061" name="linknoteref-18061" id="linknoteref-18061"> 61
      </a> Gluck, while giving full justice to the impulse <span class="side">FRENCH
      OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p020.png">[20]</a></span>
      which he had received from his poet,<a href="#linknote-18062"
      name="linknoteref-18062" id="linknoteref-18062"> 62 </a> could only
      partially yield to his whimsical exaggeration of declamatory music. But
      Calsabigi's ideas accorded with his own so far as to aid him in giving
      them clearness and precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck's demands on the musical drama went farther and deeper than
      Calsabigi's comprehension and powers could reach.<a href="#linknote-18063"
      name="linknoteref-18063" id="linknoteref-18063"> 63 </a> But in the
      meantime he accepted what was offered to him, and so were produced "Orfeo
      ed Euridice" (1762), "Alceste" (1767), and "Paride ed Elena" (1769).
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of these works betrays any apprehension of true tragedy, any trace
      of the antique mind; when the poet seeks to escape from the rhetoric of
      Italian poetry, he draws not from the Greek but from the French tragedy.
      Nor do the operas possess any proper dramatic interest. Instead of having
      a well-connected, symmetrical plot, they consist of a succession of
      detached situations closely resembling each other, which are too often
      repeated, while in details they are too broad and rhetorical. Gluck's
      principle of making music the simple exponent of the poet's words was
      calculated to give them dignity and influence. Gluck possessed not only
      boldness and energy united with intellectual acuteness; he had, what is a
      rare quality at all times, a deep perception of true grandeur. But
      although Calsabigi strove to simplify his plots and to excite the deeper
      and more powerful emotions of his audience, of <i>greatness</i> there was
      no trace in his librettos. Gluck, perceiving the latent capabilities which
      the poet had failed to develop, brought them out, as it were,
      instinctively, and while he believed himself to be following the poet, he
      was in reality himself creating all that was great and new in the work.
      His fame will be immortal, and rests upon the stately breadth of his
      designs, upon the simple truth of his representations&mdash;in short, upon
      the greatness of his artistic genius. His weakness consisted in his
      one-sided tendency <span class="side">GLUCK'S OPERAS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p021.png">[21]</a></span> to
      characterisation, a tendency in no way identical with those qualities
      which made his reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck does not abandon any of the accepted forms in his Italian operas; he
      rather, in many respects, revives older traditions. His strict treatment
      of the aria, the simplicity of his melodies, and the moderation of his
      adornments, together with his careful recitative, and especially his
      correct expression, were certainly variations on the then ruling taste,
      but not innovations on the earlier method. But in his desire to replace by
      accurate musical characterisation the ear-flattering artificial
      degeneration of operatic singing, he made use of stronger means than had
      hitherto been known. His harmonies in especial are not only more important
      and interesting in themselves, but they are used of set purpose for
      dramatic characterisation. In a similar manner the orchestra is made of
      higher use. The instruments are treated according to their
      individualities, not as combining to a purely musical effect, but as
      giving by their tone-colouring definite expression to a variety of moods;
      light and shade are carefully adjusted, and much lively execution is
      allotted to the orchestra. The effect is still further heightened by the
      frequent use of the chorus, which is intricately treated, and so becomes a
      powerful factor in the musical characterisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck extended his care to the details of scenery, to marches and dances;
      everything was to be in accordance with and characteristic of the
      situation. Here he had been preceded by Jean George Noverre (1727-1810)
      who, in his "Lettres sur la Danse et sur les Ballets" in 1760, strove for
      a reformation in the ballet on the same principles which Gluck employed
      for the opera. He condemned stereotyped forms of set dances, and demanded
      a plot for the ballet; expression should be the task of the dancer, with
      nature for his model, and the ballet-master should be both poet and
      painter. The ballets which he produced upon these principles at Stuttgart
      until 1764, then at Vienna, and after 1776 at Paris, were finished
      productions of a very pure taste, and effected a complete revolution in
      the art of dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck laid great stress upon recitative. He almost entirely abandoned the
      customary plain recitative, and used <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p022.png">[22]</a></span>
      accompanied recitative as most fitting for the dignified language of
      musical drama. Truth and power of expression are combined with a wealth of
      delicate and characteristic detail, and Gluck rarely falls into the error
      of destroying the impression of the whole by over-elaboration of detail;
      his nature was averse to all forms of triviality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here again the one-sided application of Gluck's principle becomes a
      weakness. As, according to his view, music is to be subservient to the
      words, he follows with his strongly marked recitative every turn of the
      dialogue, rhetorical and inflated as it might be, so that he not only
      employs all the resources of his art on an unworthy object, but fritters
      away the interest, on which he makes claims at once too extensive and too
      rapidly succeeding one another. Musical representation works immediately
      upon the mind and the emotions, and can do this so much more strongly and
      vividly than verse, which, however forcibly declaimed, appeals primarily
      to the intellect and the imagination, that a painful incongruity occurs
      when music, with all her resources of accurate characterisation, follows
      step by step the words of the poet. It is therefore an error to suppose
      that the music must always yield to the words; "as in a correct and
      well-composed picture," adds Gluck, "the animation of the colouring and of
      well-disposed light and shade vivifies the forms without distorting the
      outlines." But the true painter does not colour or illumine the naked
      outline; he considers the form in its total effect as a piece of
      colouring, and it exists for him only in this totality, which it is his
      object to represent. The distinction between form and colour is only
      technically important, and does not affect artistic perception and
      production. In the same way the musician has something more to do with
      respect to the words of his text than to colour given outlines. The
      conceptions which the poet has formed, with the consciousness that they
      could only attain complete independence by their combination with music,
      must be absorbed by the musician, and reproduced in the forms appointed by
      the nature of his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exaggerations attending on all forms of opposition and attempted
      reformation will not suffice to explain this <span class="side">GLUCK'S
      MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p023.png">[23]</a></span>
      important error.<a href="#linknote-18064" name="linknoteref-18064"
      id="linknoteref-18064"> 64 </a> In dealing with so great and powerful a
      mind as Gluck's we must go deeper, and seek for the cause in his artistic
      organisation alone. An ardent admirer of Gluck has pronounced<a
      href="#linknote-18065" name="linknoteref-18065" id="linknoteref-18065"> 65
      </a> that he was "more intellectually than musically great"; and certainly
      his musical productions do not correspond to the energy of his feelings
      and his will. His organisation fitted him for a reformer; as a creative
      artist his weakness became apparent. Gluck's works are not exactly
      one-sided; he expressed every variety of passion with equal skill, and he
      is never wanting in grace and charm; but he cannot be said to be rich or
      spontaneous. The lofty sentiment which he expresses in firm and
      comprehensive melodies is natural to him, but his exact and confined mode
      of composition is in part the result of his limited power of invention.
      The final cause of his desire to deprive music of her rights as an
      independent art in favour of verse lies in this weakness of his musical
      organisation. Closely connected with this is another phenomenon. It has
      been justly remarked<a href="#linknote-18066" name="linknoteref-18066"
      id="linknoteref-18066"> 66 </a> that Gluck's powers of characterisation
      extend only to soliloquies, that he failed to give proper expression to
      the dialogue proper, the contrast of voices and characters which, either
      in opposition or agreement, demonstrate their different natures; the
      polyphonal power of music, in its intellectual sense, remained undeveloped
      by Gluck. Failing in this, he failed in the highest object of music, by
      virtue of which alone she can make any claim to dramatic force. The fact
      that Gluck did not feel himself impelled to express his dramatic
      situations after this fashion is a proof that his imagination was more
      easily stirred poetically than musically. The narrow limits within which
      he occasionally confines even the music whose expression is intended to be
      purely lyrical may be traced to the same source. For Gluck did not think
      it necessary that action on the musical stage should maintain the same
      uninterrupted <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p024.png">[24]</a></span> flow as in real life. He thought
      it far more important to give a well-sustained musical representation of
      some one mood or disposition; and the more broadly such moods were
      indicated by the poet the better he was pleased. It is true that even then
      he keeps within the limits of the strictest form, but he is fond of
      employing frequent repetition, particularly when the chorus and a solo
      voice are set in opposition to each other. This way of rendering a
      dramatic idea is often of powerful effect; but, considered from an
      artistic point of view, it should be subordinated to the design of a
      grandly conceived composition expanding into a living organism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied, therefore, that Gluck failed in the working out of
      his subjects, and that he sometimes betrays a certain amount of weakness
      as well in the structure of his compositions as in their details. It was
      not for want of industry or care; it was that he did not feel the
      necessity for mastering this important side of musical representation, and
      the fact affords fresh testimony of the singularity of his musical
      organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck's first opera, "Orfeo ed Euridice," adheres most closely to the
      usual Italian style, and was indeed successfully performed in Italy.<a
      href="#linknote-18067" name="linknoteref-18067" id="linknoteref-18067"> 67
      </a> Of action in this opera there is hardly any; the introduction of
      Cupid at the beginning and the end gives it the cold allegorical character
      of the then customary festival entertainments. The broadly represented
      situations in which Orpheus mourns for Eurydice, and charms by his music
      the demons of the lower world, form the main portions of the opera; and
      they are expressed with striking fidelity and fervour of sentiment, as
      well as with great force and beauty. The use which is made of the chorus,
      and the cultivation of the orchestra, betoken great and important advances
      on the older style. The opera was well received by connoisseurs, both in
      Vienna and Paris,<a href="#linknote-18068" name="linknoteref-18068"
      id="linknoteref-18068"> 68 </a> but it does not appear to have been
      regarded as the inauguration of a reformation <span class="side">"ALCESTE,"
      1767.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p025.png">[25]</a></span>
      in music; indeed, during the next few years Gluck composed several Italian
      operas quite after the old fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alceste," however, is an avowed attempt towards a reformation of dramatic
      music, and it manifests the settled purpose and the complete individuality
      of the master. The poet offers nothing but a succession of situations
      without any progressive action; the situations turn exclusively on the
      decision of Alceste, and are employed less as psychological developments
      of character than as opportunities for a rhetorical representation of
      certain frames of mind. The character of Hercules is omitted, and the task
      of deliverance is entrusted to Apollo as an apparition in the clouds; this
      destroys an effective contrast; and the two confidants retain a suspicious
      likeness to the <i>parte seconde</i> of Italian opera. But Gluck
      considered the separate scenes not only with regard to their fitness for
      musical treatment; he felt firm ground in which he might strike root. It
      testifies to his marvellous energy of mind that no weakness was
      discernible in the repetition of such closely allied situations, and that
      he had always new shades of expression and climacteric effects at his
      command. The connection with the forms of Italian opera is not by any
      means completely severed; an unprejudiced survey discovers numerous traces
      of this, and many of the main features of the composition are the results
      of the particular way in which Gluck made use of these forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vienna public received the opera with indifference, but the critics
      welcomed it eagerly as the inauguration of a new era. Unhappily the
      critics were not by any means competent judges; Sonnenfels and Riedel were
      not cultivated musical connoisseurs.<a href="#linknote-18069"
      name="linknoteref-18069" id="linknoteref-18069"> 69 </a> The opera
      scarcely reached a more extended circle; in Italy little notice was taken
      of it; Frederick the Great had several portions of it performed before him
      without finding any enjoyment in them;<a href="#linknote-18070"

      <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p026.png">[26]</a></span> critics, while doing full justice
      to the new work, raised objections to some of the essential points of
      Gluck's principles, as carried out in it.<a href="#linknote-18071"
      name="linknoteref-18071" id="linknoteref-18071"> 71 </a> Gluck remarks
      with some resentment, in his dedication to "Paride ed Elena," on the
      lukewarmness of the public, and the want of insight and justice on the
      part of the critics; he goes on to blame the cowardice and stupidity of
      musicians, none of whom had ventured to follow his lead, and proudly
      declares his intention of maintaining his principles, to the correctness
      of which this new opera was to testify on altogether new grounds. This was
      an unlucky announcement, for "Paride ed Elena" gave no proof of Gluck's
      exceptional powers. The subject, a sufficiently poor one, is deprived of
      every vestige of interest by the interposition of Cupid in disguise
      between the lovers&mdash;a fiction which turns the whole drama into an
      absurdity. The meagre story is spun out into five acts, while to the love
      scenes, which are wanting in any true passion, independent choruses and
      dances are attached, calling for nothing beyond outward display. Gluck's
      genius for depicting the wider and deeper emotions found no task fitted to
      its powers, and the inclination to mere grace and superficiality was one
      altogether foreign to his nature. Beauties of detail do not suffice in the
      consideration of a work of art. The opera was a failure, however, and it
      does not appear to have been reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Gluck would now have paused in his endeavours,<a
      href="#linknote-18072" name="linknoteref-18072" id="linknoteref-18072"> 72
      </a> had not new prospects opened which seemed to promise good results. A
      Frenchman named Du Rollet, attached to the embassy at Vienna, and an
      enthusiast for poetry and music, asserted that the tendency of Gluck's
      principles was in essentials the same as that of French opera style. He
      therefore assured him that in Paris only would his <span class="side">"IPHIGÃ‰NIE
      EN AULIDE."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p027.png">[27]</a></span>
      reformation meet with approval, and urged that a true tragedy ought always
      to be the foundation of an opera. As an example, he suggested Racine's
      "IphigÃ©nie en Aulide," and commissioned him to arrange it as an opera, and
      to take the preliminary steps for its production in Paris. Gluck accepted
      the proposal without hesitation.,
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances were, in fact, very favourable. The principal difficulty
      against which Gluck had hitherto to contend, viz., the deep-rooted
      partiality for Italian music and its accepted forms, did not exist in
      Paris; for opera seria in its developed form had made as little way there
      as the display of fine execution, and even lovers of Italian music would
      have been loth to introduce its abuses and exaggerations of set purpose.
      French opera, on the contrary, in accordance with the genius of the
      nation, made its first principle dramatic and characteristic expression,
      which could only be attained by correct yet free treatment of musical
      forms, and by well-considered treatment of recitative. Choruses, too,
      which were for Gluck an important aid to climax and dramatic effect, were
      indispensable in French opera; and since Rameau's time the orchestra had
      been successfully employed as a means of characteristic expression. But
      the French school had hitherto failed to combine dignity and beauty with
      their dramatic force and expression; and here Gluck's Italian training
      enabled him to supply the deficiency. As far as comic opera was concerned,
      GrÃ©try had preceded him with similar efforts, and had accustomed the ear
      of the Parisians to the mingling of French and Italian music. But to carry
      out such a reformation in the grand opera required a man of commanding
      qualities; and such an one Gluck had proved himself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice of subjects was a happy one. Racine's tragedy was known as a
      masterpiece to the whole nation, and unless the adaptation were very
      clumsily made, success for the poetic share of the opera was assured. The
      advance on earlier operas is a very decided one. An important event forms
      the centre of the plot, dramatic contrasts, passions, and characters, are
      effectively portrayed. It is true that the spirit of the age of Louis XIV.
      runs <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p028.png">[28]</a></span> through it all;<a

      </a> we have Greeks in patches and powder, Monseigneur Achille and
      Princesse IphigÃ©nie behave with becoming courtesy and gallantry, and even
      the artistic representation is made subordinate to the ceremonial. But
      Gluck had been trained among these impressions, the forms were not irksome
      to him, and the greatness of his artistic individuality is nowhere more
      plainly seen than in his power of exhibiting at momentous crises the
      purely human and poetic emotions stripped of their outward disguise, and
      reflecting the ideal spirit of antique art by means of music in a way of
      which the poet had never dreamed. Gluck did not venture to depart from the
      national form of the versification; he was well aware that he must yield
      to the demands of French taste if he wished to influence the French on his
      main points. He not only strove to conform to external conditions, as, for
      instance, to the great extension of the ballet,<a href="#linknote-18074"
      name="linknoteref-18074" id="linknoteref-18074"> 74 </a> endeavouring to
      turn them to his own ends; he carefully studied the language, in order to
      declaim it and treat it musically in a way suitable to its character; he
      also eagerly studied the operas of his predecessors, Lully and Rameau,
      that he might adopt all that was truly and genuinely national in them. The
      influence of these studies may be recognised even in details; but Gluck
      turned to account whatever he adopted in a perfectly free and independent
      manner, and developed it still further. His most important innovation was
      the substitution of free Italian recitative, with the grand capabilities
      for characteristic expression given to it by Gluck himself, for the old
      "psalmodie." He changed throughout the fundamental character of the
      musical representation, and here he had no predecessors; for the treatment
      of the several parts of the composition after the Italian style, comic
      opera had, as we have seen, in some degree prepared the way. A <span
      class="side">"IPHIGÃ‰NIE EN AULIDE."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p029.png">[29]</a></span> further advance, brought about by
      the greater vividness of the dramatic impersonations, was the cultivation
      of ensemble pieces; but this, as has been already remarked, is the weakest
      side of Gluck's performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Gluck's "IphigÃ©nie" might rightfully claim to have perfected the
      French grand opera in its national sense, yet it was a difficult
      undertaking to gain recognition for this fact in Paris, and to produce
      there the work of a foreign, if not of an unknown composer. Du Rollet
      published a letter to D'Auvergne, one of the directors of the Grand-OpÃ©ra,
      in the "Mercure de France" (October, 1772), in which he acquaints him of
      Gluck's wish to produce his "IphigÃ©nie" in Paris. He laid stress on
      Gluck's having preferred the French language and music to the Italian, and
      declared that his composition of Racine's masterpiece was altogether after
      the French taste; he hoped in this way to gain the favour of the public
      and the theatre management. As this met with no response, Gluck himself
      published a letter in the "Mercure" (February, 1773), in which, without
      undue submission, he reiterates the wish; he wastes great praise on J. J.
      Rousseau, who was destined to be the most determined opponent of the
      French language and music. At last Gluck succeeded in gaining the interest
      of the Dauphiness, Marie Antoinette, all difficulties were overcome, and
      in the autumn of 1773 Gluck went to Paris to put his opera in rehearsal.<a
      href="#linknote-18075" name="linknoteref-18075" id="linknoteref-18075"> 75
      </a> Again hindrances were thrown in his way which it required all the
      force and vigour of his character to overcome. The hardest struggle was
      with the vocalists, male and female, and with the orchestra; they must be
      attached to him at all costs. But he was an implacable conductor,<a
      href="#linknote-18076" name="linknoteref-18076" id="linknoteref-18076"> 76
      </a> and never gave way before a storm.<a href="#linknote-18077"
      name="linknoteref-18077" id="linknoteref-18077"> 77 </a> After six months
      rehearsing, "IphigÃ©nie" was performed (February 14, 1774); the success of
      the first performance was not brilliant, but the second quite confirmed
      the victory. Gluck had succeeded (an important point in Paris) in raising
      public expectation to a high pitch <span class="side">FRENCH OPERA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p030.png">[30]</a></span>
      beforehand, and he found zealous supporters among the journalists,
      especially the AbbÃ© Arnaud; the opposition engendered by the enthusiastic
      partisanship of his admirers was in his favour in so far that it prevented
      the interest of the public from becoming faint.<a href="#linknote-18078"
      name="linknoteref-18078" id="linknoteref-18078"> 78 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposition came, as might have been expected, from both sides;<a
      href="#linknote-18079" name="linknoteref-18079" id="linknoteref-18079"> 79
      </a> the followers of Lully and Rameau would not grant any progress made,
      and saw in Gluck's innovations nothing but the harmful influence of
      Italian music,<a href="#linknote-18080" name="linknoteref-18080"
      id="linknoteref-18080"> 80 </a> while the partisans of the Italians looked
      upon Gluck's music as essentially identical with the "old French," and
      complained of the "tudesque" modifications of the Italian style.<a
      href="#linknote-18081" name="linknoteref-18081" id="linknoteref-18081"> 81
      </a> As usual, neither party was satisfied with the concessions made to
      it, and still less would either acknowledge that its strong places had
      been overthrown. J. J. Rousseau alone acknowledged himself vanquished; and
      as he had previously done justice to GrÃ©try's efforts, so he now extolled
      Gluck's music as being genuinely dramatic.<a href="#linknote-18082"
      name="linknoteref-18082" id="linknoteref-18082"> 82 </a> Not so Grimm. He
      was too well versed in Italian music not to perceive that if Gluck's ideas
      became prevalent, those forms which he held to be essential would soon be
      annihilated; Gluck's operas appeared to him a revival of the old French
      style, which would <span class="side">GLUCK'S OPERAS IN VIENNA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p031.png">[31]</a></span> only
      hinder or retard the triumph of the Italian. It is true that out of
      deference to public opinion, and to that of many of his friends and of
      Gluck's royal patroness, he does not express himself very positively on
      the subject, but his real views cannot be mistaken.<a
      href="#linknote-18083" name="linknoteref-18083" id="linknoteref-18083"> 83
      </a>

    <p>
      With just discrimination the directors had declared that they would not
      risk appearing before the public with one of Gluck's operas; if he would
      write six, they might have a chance of success. Gluck himself was aware
      that if he was to succeed in the long run, his "IphigÃ©nie" must not be
      left long alone. He rapidly revised and elaborated "OrphÃ©e et Euridice,"
      not at all to the advantage of the opera, in which he was induced, quite
      against his principles, to insert a long bravura aria by Bertoni.<a
      href="#linknote-18084" name="linknoteref-18084" id="linknoteref-18084"> 84
      </a> It was performed on August 2, 1774, with great success,<a
      href="#linknote-18085" name="linknoteref-18085" id="linknoteref-18085"> 85
      </a> and was followed on February 27, 1775, by a one-act opera, "L'Arbre
      EnchantÃ©," and on August 11, 1775, by an opera in three acts, "La CythÃ¨re
      AssiÃ©gÃ©e," neither of which had any lasting effect. In order to insure a
      fresh and lasting success Gluck took in hand his "Alceste" anew. The text
      was thoroughly revised by Du Rollet, with the adoption of Rousseau's
      suggestions, especially in the second act; Hercules is introduced again,
      but not very skilfully.<a href="#linknote-18086" name="linknoteref-18086"
      id="linknoteref-18086"> 86 </a> Gluck's revision was a very thorough one;
      the old music was transposed, curtailed, or lengthened, the details
      altered, and new passages inserted, generally with admirable
      discrimination.<a href="#linknote-18087" name="linknoteref-18087"
      id="linknoteref-18087"> 87 </a> Then, in order to put new works in direct
      competition with his old compositions, he undertook to set operas by
      Quinault to music unaltered, and chose "Roland" and "Armida."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Gluck was engaged on these works in Vienna, the <span class="side">FRENCH
      OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p032.png">[32]</a></span>
      supporters of Italian music, who were now convinced of the possibility of
      procuring foreign composers for the grand opera, sought on their side to
      oppose a rival to Gluck. Some time previously Madame Dubarry had been
      induced by La Borde's influence to obtain the presence in Paris of
      Piccinni, the most esteemed of Italian composers.<a href="#linknote-18088"
      name="linknoteref-18088" id="linknoteref-18088"> 88 </a> The Neapolitan
      ambassador, the Marquis Caraccioli, by his intellect and position a
      powerful patron of the arts and sciences, had been mainly instrumental in
      summoning Piccinni; and the young Queen, Marie Antoinette, who saw no
      necessity for bending her inclinations to party interests in the matter of
      music, and who, like her brother the Emperor, was personally attached to
      Italian music, gave her consent to Piccinni's appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmontel declared himself ready to adapt an opera by Quinault for
      Piccinni, of whose music he announced himself the champion.<a
      href="#linknote-18089" name="linknoteref-18089" id="linknoteref-18089"> 89
      </a> When Gluck heard that the work selected was the "Roland," on which he
      was already at work, he published a letter ("AnnÃ©e LittÃ©raire," 1776), in
      which he bitterly complained of this affront, and violently assailed his
      adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open war was now declared between the critics of the Gluckists and the
      Piccinnists, and carried on in pamphlets, journal articles, and epigrams,
      with so much violence that even the public were led into a partisanship
      more eager than had ever before arisen from a question of art.<a
      href="#linknote-18090" name="linknoteref-18090" id="linknoteref-18090"> 90
      </a> The leaders of the Piccinnists were Marmontel and La Harpe, while
      Gluck's faithful partisans were Arnaud and Suard, who appeared as the
      Anonymous of Vaugirard.<a href="#linknote-18091" name="linknoteref-18091"
      id="linknoteref-18091"> 91 </a> Grimm took no direct share in the contest;
      but his comments on it show him, <span class="side">GLUCKISTS AND

      in spite of apparent impartiality, to have been decidedly on the side of
      Piccinni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first performance of "Alceste," on April 23, 1776, was a failure, and
      it only gained in public favour by slow degrees.<a href="#linknote-18092"
      name="linknoteref-18092" id="linknoteref-18092"> 92 </a> "IphigÃ©nie," too,
      which was reproduced, was severely criticised. But this severity served
      but to increase public sympathy, and Gluck's operas drew full houses, and
      became more and more unmistakably popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piccinni arrived in Paris quite at the end of 1776. He was welcomed by all
      the composers, GrÃ©try alone failing to pay his respects to him. For this
      he was severely censured, since on first coming to Paris he had announced
      himself as a pupil of Piccinni, which he was not.<a href="#linknote-18093"
      name="linknoteref-18093" id="linknoteref-18093"> 93 </a> Strange and
      unknown in Paris, Piccinni took a great distaste to its harsh climate, its
      unaccustomed way of living. His ignorance of the French language isolated
      him and debarred him from any personal share in the contest of which he
      was the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      His easy-going and peace-loving temperament prevented his wishing to join
      in the fray, while for Gluck's passionate nature it was a satisfaction to
      give vent to angry vituperation in the public journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmontel relates how he had to instruct Piccinni in French by reading him
      his opera every day as a task, and translating what Piccinni had to
      compose.<a href="#linknote-18094" name="linknoteref-18094"
      id="linknoteref-18094"> 94 </a> Thus slowly proceeded the work of the
      dissatisfied maestro, and every day he doubted of its success more and
      more.<a href="#linknote-18095" name="linknoteref-18095"
      id="linknoteref-18095"> 95 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gluck began the rehearsals of his "Armide" in July, 1777, and it was
      performed on September 23. The opera, on which Gluck had built such
      confident hopes of success, was very coolly received.<a
      href="#linknote-18096" name="linknoteref-18096" id="linknoteref-18096"> 96
      </a> Its failure was owing partly to
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p034.png">[34]</a></span> the
      dangerous rivalry of Lully, partly to the fact that the subject was not
      suited to his genius,<a href="#linknote-18097" name="linknoteref-18097"
      id="linknoteref-18097"> 97 </a> and partly also to the premonitory shadow
      of Piccinni's new work. Justice was not done to "Armide" until later.<a
      href="#linknote-18098" name="linknoteref-18098" id="linknoteref-18098"> 98
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      La Harpe attacked it bitterly, and Gluck, in a violent retort, called for
      the aid of the Anonymous of Vaugirard, which did not tarry. Then began the
      rehearsals of Piccinni's opera, and the storm of partisanship was let
      loose.<a href="#linknote-18099" name="linknoteref-18099"
      id="linknoteref-18099"> 99 </a> Piccinni was incapable of restraining it.
      While his friends espoused his cause with zeal, while Gluck himself sought

      name="linknoteref-180100" id="linknoteref-180100"> 100 </a> Piccinni
      looked sorrowfully to heaven and sighed, "Ah! toutte va male, toutte!"
      Firmly convinced that the opera would be a failure, and resolved to return
      to Naples on the following day, he went to the first performance (January,
      1778), consoling his family with the assurance that a cultivated nation
      like the French would do a composer no bodily harm, even if they did not
      admire his operas&mdash;and experienced a brilliant triumph.<a

      SUCH was the condition of musical affairs <span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p034.png">[34]</a></span>at the time of Mozart's arrival
      in Paris. The successes on either side, and the violence of partisan
      controversy, had, as might have been expected, prevented any decisive
      conclusion of the dispute. We know now that Gluck remained master of the
      field, and that the influence of Lully and Rameau sinking henceforth into
      oblivion, Gluck determined the character of French opera in all its
      essential points as it still exists, in spite of its many Italian
      modifications. But at the time of <span class="side">UNFAVOURABLE
      PROSPECTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p035.png">[35]</a></span>
      which we are speaking the Gluckists and Piccinnists were carrying on the
      warfare with greater bitterness than ever, and the old national party,
      although pushed into the background, was seeking to free itself from both
      influences.<a href="#linknote-1901" name="linknoteref-1901"
      id="linknoteref-1901"> 1 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the public was more eagerly excited than ever, but, as
      usual, more for the sake of the literary scandal and personal animosity
      than with any love of art, and when audiences flocked to the opera they
      desired not to enjoy but to participate in what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an unfortunate state of things for a young composer whose object
      was to acquire an honourable position for himself; he must, in order to be
      heard at all, attach himself to one or other party, and so lose his
      independence, the only true foundation of excellence. To put an end to the
      dispute by forcing the combatants to acknowledge a success greater than
      that of either was at this juncture beyond the power of even a
      transcendent genius; and Mozart brought nothing with him to Paris but his
      genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had failed in obtaining an introduction to the Queen Marie Antoinette
      from Vienna, and access to the circle of the nobility was no easy matter.
      Mozart had little to expect from the support of his fellow-artists, for
      they were all ranged against each other, and had enough to do to fight
      their own battles. Gluck had left Paris when Mozart entered it; he renewed
      his acquaintance with Piccinni, whom he had known in Italy (Vol. I., p.
      111), and was polite in his greetings when he met him at the Concert
      Spirituel and elsewhere; but there the intercourse ended. "I know my
      affairs, and he his, and that suffices" (July 9, 1778).
    </p>
    <p>
      We find no traces of any acquaintance with GrÃ©try, who never mentions
      Mozart in his "MÃ©moires." He was resigned to professional envy, and had
      already experienced his full share of it; but in Paris at that time the
      "gens de lettres" were the arbiters of taste and fashion. Pamphlets and
      critical articles, epigrams and <i>bon mots</i>, proceeding from <span
      class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p036.png">[36]</a></span> the literary circle, ruled public
      opinion, and a thorough knowledge of music was, as a rule, the last
      requirement thought of by those who strove to influence its progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new world to Wolfgang, in which he would have found it difficult
      to move successfully and uprightly, even if he had gained access to its
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimm, who might have introduced him, was himself a partisan, and esteemed
      only by his own party; besides which, he could not fail soon to discover
      that Mozart was the last man in the world for this kind of intercourse.
      Nevertheless, he received him very kindly, and sought to make him known
      wherever he could; they were always quite of accord in their opinions of
      French music. "Baron Grimm and I," writes Mozart (April 5, 1778), "often
      pour out our wrath over the music of the present day, but in private, be
      it understood; in public, it is all 'bravo, bravissimo,' and clapping
      one's hands till the fingers burn." And in another letter he says: "What
      annoys me is that the French have improved their taste just enough to
      enable them to listen to good music. But their own is still very bad. Ay!
      upon my word, but it is! and their singing! <i>oime!</i> If they would
      only let Italian songs alone, I could forgive their Frenchified
      chirruping; but it is really unpardonable so to spoil good music."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's outward circumstances were not pleasant. In order to economise
      (for his mother found everything in Paris half as dear again as elsewhere)
      they took a dark, uncomfortable lodging, so small that Wolfgang could not
      get his clavier into it. But their life was rendered considerably more
      cheerful by the presence of their Mannheim friends. "Wendling," writes the
      mother (April 5) (there is no more talk of his irreligion), "has prepared
      Wolfgang's way for him, and has now introduced him to all his friends. He
      is a true benefactor, and M. von Grimm has promised him to use all his
      influence, which is greater than Wendling's, to make Wolfgang known." In
      Paris, too, Mozart became better acquainted with Raaff, and learned to
      value him as an artist and as a friend. This was greatly owing to the
      interest Raaff took in the Weber family; he appreciated <span class="side">WOLFGANG'S
      HOPES AND FEARS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p037.png">[37]</a></span>
      Aloysia's talents, promised to give her lessons, and approved of Mozart's
      liking for her; this was all the greater consolation since he dared not
      speak openly on the subject to his father, although he did not attempt to
      conceal his correspondence with the Weber family. Nor could his wishes and
      feelings fail to be perceived when he wrote (July 3, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never been backward, and never will be. I will always use my powers
      to the uttermost. God can make all things good. I have something in my
      mind, for which I pray to God daily; if it is His Divine will it will come
      to pass; if not, I am content. I have at least done my best. If all goes
      well, and things turn out as I wish, then you must do your share, or the
      whole business will fall through; I trust to your kindness to do it. Do
      not attempt to discover my meaning, for the immediate favour I have to beg
      of you is to let me keep my ideas to myself until the right time comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not seem to have been very hopeful (March 29, 1778)
    </p>
    <p>
      I am pretty well, thank God: but for the rest, I often scarcely know or
      care for anything; I am quite indifferent, and take little pleasure in
      anything. What most supports and invigorates me is the thought that you,
      dear father, and my dear sister are safe and well, that I am an honest
      German; and that although I cannot always say what I like, I can always
      think what I like&mdash;which is the main point.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a mood like this the encouragement of musical compatriots would be
      doubly grateful to him. This was freely bestowed on him by the ambassador
      from the Palatinate, Count von Sickingen, to whom Gemmingen and Cannabich
      had given him letters, and Raaff a personal introduction:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a charming man, a passionate lover and true judge of music. I spent
      eight hours with him quite alone; we were at the clavier morning and
      afternoon, and up to ten o'clock in the evening, all the time making,
      praising, admiring, altering, discussing, and criticising nothing but
      music: he has about thirty operatic scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      He maintained this acquaintance zealously, often dining with the Count,
      and spending the evening over his own compositions with so much interest
      that the time went without their knowing it (June 12, 1778).

      The Mannheim friends were engaged for the Concert Spirituel, which had
      been founded in 1725. Anne Danican Philidor, elder brother to the composer
      already mentioned, was accorded the privilege, on payment of a fixed sum,
      of giving about four-and-twenty concerts in the course of the year, on
      festivals when there was no grand opera. They were given in a hall of the
      Tuileries, and consisted of instrumental music, and sacred or classical
      compositions for chorus or solo singing.<a href="#linknote-1902"
      name="linknoteref-1902" id="linknoteref-1902"> 2 </a> Wolfgang was
      introduced to the director, Jean le Gros (1739-1793), and at once received
      from him a commission, with which he acquaints his father (April 5, 1778).
    </p>
    <p>
      The kapellmeister, Holzbauer, has sent a Miserere; but the Mannheim chorus
      being weak and bad, while here it is good and strong, his choruses make no
      effect; therefore M. le Gros has commissioned me to write other choruses.
      Holzbauer's introductory chorus remains; the first by me is "Quoniam
      iniquitatem meam ego," &amp;c., allegro; the second, adagio, "Ecce enim in
      iniquitatibus"; then, allegro, "Ecce enim veritatem dilexisti," up to
      "ossa humiliata." Then an andante for soprano, tenor and bass soli, "Cor
      mundum crÃ©a"; and "Redde mihi lÃ¦titiam," allegro as far as "te
      convertentur." Then I have done a recitative for the basses, "Libera me de
      sanguinibus," because it is followed by a bass song by Holzbauer, "Domine,
      labia mea." In the same way, because "Sacrificium Deo, spiritus" is an
      andante tenor air for Raaff, with solo oboe and bassoon, I have added a
      little recitative, "Quoniam si voluisses," also with oboe and bassoon
      concertante: recitatives are very much in vogue here. "Benigne fac" up to
      "muri Jerusalem," andante moderato, chorus. Then "Tunc acceptabis" to
      "super altare tuum vitulos," allegro, tenor solo (Le Gros), and chorus
      together.<a href="#linknote-1903" name="linknoteref-1903"
      id="linknoteref-1903"> 3 </a> I must say I am glad I have finished this
      work, for it is confoundedly awkward when one is in a hurry with work and
      cannot write at home. But it is finished, thank God, and will, I think,
      make an effect. M. Gossec, whom you must know, told M. Le Gros, after
      seeing my first chorus, that it was charming, and would certainly tell in
      performance; that the words were well arranged, and admirably set to
      music. He is a good friend of mine, but a dry, reserved man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this scampering work (for Mozart was only a few <span class="side">COMPOSITIONS
      FOR THE CONCERT SPIRITUEL</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p039.png">[39]</a></span> days over it) should form his <i>dÃ©but</i>
      before the French public caused his father great uneasiness; but it was
      uncalled for, for in his next letter Wolfgang informs him (March 1, 1778)
    </p>
    <p>
      I must tell you, by the way, that my chorus work came to nothing.
      Holzbauer's Miserere is too long as it is, and did not please; besides
      which, they only performed two of my choruses instead of four, and left
      out the best. It did not much matter, for many people did not know that
      they were mine, and many more never heard of me. Notwithstanding, they
      were highly applauded at rehearsal, and, what is more important (for I do
      not think much of Parisian applause), I liked them myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another work was occasioned by the presence of the Mannheim performers,
      with whom was associated the celebrated hornist, Joh. Punto (1748-1803),
      who in Mozart's opinion "played magnificently." Mozart set to work at a
      Sinfonie Concertante for flute (Wendling), oboe (Ramm), French horn
      (Punto), and bassoon (Ritter), which was to be performed at one of the
      concerts. But he was soon obliged to write to his father (May 1, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another "hickl-hackl" with the Sinfonie Concertante. I believe
      there is something behind, for I have my enemies here, as where have I not
      had them? It is a good sign, however. I was obliged to write the symphony
      in great haste, worked hard at it, and thoroughly satisfied the four
      performers. Le Gros had it four days for copying, and I always found it
      lying in the same place. At last, the day but one before the concert, I
      did not find it; searched about among the music, and found it hidden away.
      I could do nothing but ask Le Gros, "<i>A propos</i>, have you given the
      Sinfonie Concertante to be copied?" "No, I forgot it." Of course I could
      not order him to have it copied and played, so said nothing. The day it
      should have been performed I went to the concert; Ramm and Punto came up
      to me in a rage, and asked why my sinfonie concertante was not played. "I
      do not know; this is the first I have heard of it." Ramm was furious, and
      abused Le Gros in French, saying that it was unhandsome of him, &amp;c.
      What annoyed me most in the whole affair was Le Gros not telling me a word
      about it, as if I was to know nothing of it. If he had only made an
      apology, that the time was too short, or anything; but no, not a word.<a
      href="#linknote-1904" name="linknoteref-1904" id="linknoteref-1904"> 4
      </a> I think Cambini, an Italian <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p040.png">[40]</a></span> composer
      here, is at the bottom of it, for I was the innocent cause of his being
      extinguished on his first introduction to Le Gros. He has written some
      pretty quartets, one of which I had heard at Mannheim; I praised it to
      him, and played the beginning; Ritter, Ramm, and Punto were there, and
      they left me no peace, insisting that I should go on, and make up myself
      what I could not remember. So I did it, and Cambini was quite beside
      himself, and could not refrain from saying, "Questa Ã¨ una gran testa!" But
      it must have been sorely against the grain with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was of the same opinion, and warned Wolfgang that Cambini would
      not be the only one who would seek to injure him; but he must not allow
      himself to be disconcerted (April 29, 1778). Wolfgang expressed himself
      with considerable dissatisfaction:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were a place where the people had ears to hear, and a heart to
      feel, and just a little understanding and taste for music, I would laugh
      from my heart at all these things; but, as far as music is concerned, I am
      among a set of dolts and blockheads. How can it be otherwise? They are
      just the same in all their transactions, love-affairs, and passions. There
      is no place in the world like Paris. You must not think that I exaggerate
      in speaking so of the music here. Ask whom you will (only not a native
      Frenchman), and they will tell you the same. Well, I am here, and must
      make the best of it, for your sake. I shall thank the Almighty if I come
      out of it with unvitiated taste. I pray to God daily to give me grace to
      stand firm, and do honour to myself and the German nation, and that He
      will grant me success, so that I may make plenty of money, help you out of
      all your present troubles, and that we may meet once more, and all live
      happily together again.

      Through the good offices of Grimm, Mozart was recommended to the Duc de
      Guines, who had been recalled from his post as Ambassador in London after
      his notorious lawsuit with secretary Tort<a href="#linknote-1905"
      name="linknoteref-1905" id="linknoteref-1905"> 5 </a> in 1776, and stood
      high in favour with the Queen.<a href="#linknote-1906"
      name="linknoteref-1906" id="linknoteref-1906"> 6 </a> L. Mozart wrote
      (March 28, 1778):<a href="#linknote-1907" name="linknoteref-1907"
      id="linknoteref-1907"> 7 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Son,&mdash;I beg that you will do your best to gain the friendship
      of the Duc de Guines, and to keep well with him; I have frequently read in
      the papers of his high place in the royal favour; the Queen being now <i>enceinte</i>,
      there are sure to be grand festivities when the child is born; you may get
      something to do, and make your fortune; for in these cases everything
      depends upon the pleasure of the Queen. <span class="side">CONCERTO IN C
      MAJOR.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p041.png">[41]</a></span>
      The Duke was amusing and fond of music;<a href="#linknote-1908"
      name="linknoteref-1908" id="linknoteref-1908"> 8 </a> as Mozart himself
      says, he played the flute inimitably, and his daughter the harp
      magnificently.<a href="#linknote-1909" name="linknoteref-1909"
      id="linknoteref-1909"> 9 </a> He gave Mozart a commission to compose a
      concerto for flute and harp. These were exactly the two instruments which
      Mozart could not endure.<a href="#linknote-19010" name="linknoteref-19010"
      id="linknoteref-19010"> 10 </a> But this did not prevent his accomplishing
      his task to the perfect satisfaction of the Duke. The concerto (299 K.) is
      in C major, with accompaniments for a small orchestra, and consists of the
      usual three movements. In conformity with the nature of the instruments
      the character of the concerto is cheerful and graceful, and it is
      excellent of its kind. Each movement is well and compactly formed, and has
      an abundance of rich melody, enhanced in effect by the harmonic treatment,
      the varied character of the accompaniment, and the alternation of the solo
      instruments. The thematic treatment is only lightly sketched in so as to
      keep the interest alive; but in the middle movement of the first part the
      harmonic arrangement betrays a master-hand; at its close a fresh melody is
      introduced, as was then the rule, in order to excite the attention anew.
      Especially graceful and tender is the Andantino, accompanied only by a
      quartet. The solo instruments are brilliant without being particularly
      difficult; the orchestra is discreetly made use of to support the delicate
      solo instruments without interfering with their effect; but the easy
      setting <i>Ã¤ jour</i> is elaborated in detail with great skill and
      decision, both as regards the sound effects and the passages and turns of
      the accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, Mozart gave the Duke's daughter two hours' lessons in
      composition daily, for which generous payment might be expected. He
      describes the lessons minutely (May 14, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She has talent and even genius, but especially has she a marvellous
      memory: she knows two hundred pieces, and can play them all by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once when we were talking of instruments, Mozart said that he detested
      the harp and the flute."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p042.png">[42]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      She is, however, very doubtful whether she has any talent for composition,
      particularly as regards ideas and imagination; but her father&mdash;who,
      between ourselves, is a little infatuated about her&mdash;says she has
      plenty of ideas, but is over-modest, and has too little confidence in
      herself. Well, we shall see. If she does not get any ideas or imagination
      (at present she has absolutely none) it is all in vain, for, God knows, I
      cannot give them to her. Her father has no intention of making her into a
      great composer. "I do not wish her," says he, "to write operas, concertos,
      songs, or symphonies, but only grand sonatas for her instrument and mine."
      To-day I gave her her fourth lesson, and, as far as regards the rules of
      composition and exercises, I am fairly satisfied. She has supplied a very
      good bass to the first minuet which I set her. She is beginning now to
      write in three parts. She does it, but she gets <i>ennuyÃ©e</i>. I cannot
      help it, for I cannot possibly take her farther. Even if she had genius it
      would be too soon, and unhappily she has none&mdash;everything must be
      done artificially. She has no ideas, and so nothing comes of it. I have
      tried her in every sort of way. Among other things, it came into my head
      to write down a very simple minuet, and to try if she could write a
      variation on it. No; it was in vain. "Well," I thought, "she does not know
      how to begin;" so I began to vary the first bar, and told her to go on
      with it, and keep the same idea; and at last she managed it. When that was
      done, I told her to begin something herself, only the first part of a
      melody. She reflected for a quarter of an hour, but nothing came of it.
      Then I wrote the first four bars of a minuet, and said, "See what a donkey
      I am; I have begun a minuet, and cannot even finish the first part. Be so
      kind as to do it for me." She thought it was impossible. At last, after
      much trouble, something came to light; and I was very glad of it. Then I
      made her complete the minuet&mdash;only the first part, of course. I have
      given her nothing to do at home but to alter my four bars, and make
      something out of them&mdash;to invent a new beginning, even if the harmony
      is the same, so long as the melody is altered. I shall see to-morrow what
      she has made of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was justly astonished at the demands made by Wolfgang on the
      talent of his pupil, and on the earnestness with which he threw himself
      into his task (May 28,1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You write that you have just given Mdlle. de Guines her fourth lesson, and
      you want her to write down her own ideas; do you think that everybody has
      your genius? It will come in time. She has a good memory; let her <i>steal,</i>
      or more politely, <i>adapt</i>; it does no harm at the beginning, until
      courage comes. Your plan of variations is a good one, only persevere. If
      M. le Duc sees anything, however small, by his daughter, he will be
      delighted. It is really an excellent acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Wolfgang had not the art of cultivating such <span class="side">LIFE
      IN PARIS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p043.png">[43]</a></span>
      acquaintances any more than of giving lessons in composition to young
      ladies of no talent; he wrote later that she was thoroughly stupid and
      thoroughly lazy (July 9, 1778), and in conclusion the Duke offered him two
      louis-d'or, which he indignantly rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some other pupils, and might have had more had not the distances in
      Paris been so great that his time was too much curtailed thereby; he
      complains (July 31, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no joke to give lessons here. You must not think that it is
      laziness; no! but it is quite against my nature, my way of life. You know
      that I, so to speak, live in music; that I am busy at it the whole day,
      planning, studying, considering. Lessons come in the way of this; I shall
      certainly have some hours free, but I need them rather for rest than for
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highly distasteful to him also were visits to people of rank, and attempts
      to gain their favour. He enumerates all the disagreeables of it (May 1,
      1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You write that I should pay plenty of visits to make new acquaintances and
      renew old ones. It is really impossible. To go on foot takes too long and
      makes one too dirty, for Paris is inconceivably filthy; and to drive costs
      four or five livres a day, and all for nothing; the people pay compliments
      and nothing more; engage me for such or such a day, and then I play, and
      they say "Oh! c'est un prodige, c'est inconcevable, c'est Ã©tonnant!" and
      then adieu. I have already spent money enough in that way, and often
      uselessly, for the people have been out. No one can know the annoyance of
      it who is not here. Paris is very much altered; the French are not nearly
      so polite as they were fourteen years ago; they approach very near to
      rudeness now, and are dreadfully arrogant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example which he gives his father sufficiently justifies his
      complaints, and is as significant of the impertinence of the nobility
      towards artists as of Mozart's powerlessness to resent such behaviour:&mdash;
    </p>

      M. Grimm gave me a letter to Madame la Duchesse de Chabot,<a
      href="#linknote-19011" name="linknoteref-19011" id="linknoteref-19011"> 11
      </a> and I went there. The purport of the letter was principally to
      recommend me <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p044.png">[44]</a></span> to the Duchesse de Bourbon<a
      href="#linknote-19012" name="linknoteref-19012" id="linknoteref-19012"> 12
      </a> (then in a convent),<a href="#linknote-19013" name="linknoteref-19013"
      id="linknoteref-19013"> 13 </a> and to bring me again to her remembrance.
      A week passed without any notice taken; but, as she had already commanded
      my presence in that time, I went. I was left to wait half an hour in an
      icily cold, very large room, with no stove or means of heating it. At last
      the Duchesse de Chabot came in, and politely begged me to make allowances
      for the clavier, since she had none in good order; would I try it? I said
      I should have been delighted to play something, but that I could not feel
      my fingers for the cold, and I begged her to allow me to go to a room
      where at least there was a stove. "Oh, oui, monsieur; vous avez raison,"
      was her only answer. Then she sat down and began to draw for at least an
      hour with some other gentlemen, who all sat round a great table. I had the
      honour of standing waiting this hour. The doors and windows were open;
      very soon, not only my hands, but my feet and whole body were stiff with
      cold, and my head began to ache. No one spoke to me, and I did not know
      what to do for cold, headache, and fatigue. At last, to cut it short, I
      played on the wretched, miserable pianoforte. The most vexatious part of
      all was that Madame and all the gentlemen went on with their employment
      without a moment's pause or notice, so that I played for the walls and
      chairs. All these things put together were too much for my patience. I
      began the Fischer variations, played the half, and got up. Then followed
      no end of <i>Ã©loges</i>. I said what was quite true, that I could do
      myself no credit with such a clavier, and that I should be very pleased to
      appoint another day when I could have a better clavier. But she did not
      consent, and I was obliged to wait another half-hour, till her husband
      came in.<a href="#linknote-19014" name="linknoteref-19014"
      id="linknoteref-19014"> 14 </a> But he sat down beside me, and listened
      with all attention; and then I&mdash;I forgot cold, and headache, and
      annoyance, and played on the wretched clavier as you know I can play when
      I am in a good humour. Give me the best clavier in Europe, but with an
      audience who do not or will not understand and feel with me when I play,
      and I lose all pleasure in it. I told the whole affair to M. Grimm.

      Wolfgang tells his father (May 14, 1778) of a prospect of a settled
      position, in which, however, he was disappointed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolph (the French horn-player) is in the royal service here, and very
      friendly to me. He has offered me the place of organist at Versailles, if
      I like to take it. It brings in 2,000 livres a year, but I should have to
      live six months at Versailles, the other six where I <span class="side">OFFER
      OF COURT SERVICE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p045.png">[45]</a></span>
      chose. I must ask the advice of my friends, for 2,000 livres is no such
      great sum. It would be if it were in German coin, but not here; it makes
      83 louis-d'or and 8 livres a year; that is, 915 florins 45 kreutzers of
      our money (a large sum), but only 333 dollars and 2 livres here, which is
      not much. It is dreadful how soon a dollar goes! I cannot be surprised at
      people thinking so little of a louis-d'or here, for it is very little;
      four dollars, or a louis-d'or, which is the same thing, are gone directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, who considered a settled position of such importance that a
      certain amount of concession should be made for it, advised him to reflect
      well on the proposal, if indeed Rudolph (1730-1812), who had been a member
      of the band since 1763, had sufficient influence to bring it about (May
      28, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not reject it at once. You must consider that the 83 louis-d'or
      are earned in six months; that you have half the year for other work; that
      it probably is a permanent post, whether you are ill or well; that you can
      give it up when you like; that you are <i>at Court, consequently</i> daily
      under the eyes of the King and Queen, and so much the nearer your fortune;
      that you may be promoted to one of the two kapellmeisters' places; that in
      time, if promotion is the rule, you may become clavier-master to the royal
      family, which would be a lucrative post; that there would be nothing to
      hinder your writing for the theatre, concert spirituel, &amp;c., and
      printing music with dedications to your grand acquaintance among the
      ministers who frequent Versailles, especially in summer; that Versailles
      itself is a small town, or at all events, has many respectable
      inhabitants, among whom pupils would surely be found; and that, finally,
      this is the surest way to the favour and protection of the queen. Read
      this to the Baron von Grimm, and ask his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grimm took Wolfgang's view of the matter, expressed in his answer to
      his father (July 3, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My inclination has never turned towards Versailles; I took the advice of
      Baron Grimm, and others of my best friends, and they all thought with me.
      It is small pay. I should have to waste half the year in a place where
      nothing else could be earned, and where my talents would be buried. For to
      be in the royal service is to be forgotten in Paris&mdash;and then to be
      only organist! I should like a good post extremely, but nothing less than
      kapellmeister&mdash;and well paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's absorbing desire was to have an opportunity of distinguishing
      himself as a composer, above all things by an opera. There seemed a fair
      prospect of doing this soon <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p046.png">[46]</a></span> after his
      arrival in Paris. He had renewed his acquaintance with Noverre (p. 145),
      who, after giving up the direction of the ballet at Vienna in 1775, had,
      through the Queen's influence, been appointed ballet-master to the
      Grand-OpÃ©ra in 1776.<a href="#linknote-19015" name="linknoteref-19015"
      id="linknoteref-19015"> 15 </a> He took such a liking for Mozart that he
      not only invited him to his table as often as he chose, but commissioned
      him to write an opera. He proposed as a good subject, "Alexander and
      Roxane," and set a librettist to work at the adaptation of it. The first
      act was ready at the beginning of April; and a month later Mozart was in
      hopes of receiving the whole text. It had then to be submitted to the
      approbation of the director of the Grand-OpÃ©ra, De Vismes; but this did
      not seem to offer any difficulty, Noverre's influence being powerful with
      the director.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as L. Mozart heard of the prospect of an opera, he wrote (April
      12, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I strongly advise you, before writing for the French stage, to hear their
      operas, and find what pleases them. In this way you will become quite a
      Frenchman, and I hope you will be specially careful to accustom yourself
      to the proper accent of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he continues to impress upon him (April 29, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you tell me you are about to write an opera, follow my advice,
      and reflect that your whole reputation hangs on your first piece. Listen
      before you write, and study the national taste; listen to their operas,
      and examine them. I know your wonderful powers of imitation. Do not write
      hurriedly&mdash;no sensible composer does that. Study the words beforehand
      with Baron von Grimm and Noverre; make sketches, and let them hear them.
      It is always done: Voltaire reads his poems to his friends, hears their
      judgments, and follows their suggestions. Your honour and profit depend
      upon it; and as soon as we have money we will go to Italy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfgang was aware of the difficulties which lay before him, especially
      with regard to the language and the vocalists, and expressed himself
      energetically on both points (July 9, 1778)
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do get as far as writing an opera, I shall have trouble enough over
      it; that I do not mind, for I am used to it, if only this cursed French
      <span class="side">PROSPECTS OF AN OPERA, 1778.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p047.png">[47]</a></span> language were
      not so utterly opposed to music! It is truly miserable; German is divine
      in comparison. And then the vocalists, male and female! they have no right
      to the name, for they do not sing, but shriek and howl, and all from the
      nose and the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all this, he was eager to set to work (July 31, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you that I shall be only too pleased if I do succeed in writing
      an opera. The language is the invention of the devil, that is true; and
      the same difficulties are before me that beset all composers; but I feel
      as well able as any one else to surmount them; in fact, when I tell myself
      that all goes well with my opera, I feel a fire within me, and my limbs
      tingle with the desire to make the French know, honour, and fear the
      German nation more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime L. Mozart heard that at the very time when Noverre was
      interesting himself so warmly in Wolfgang's opera, he had engaged him to
      write the music for a ballet which was coming out (May 14, 1778). When,
      after a considerable lapse of time, the father inquired what had become of
      this ballet, and what he had made by it, Wolfgang had almost forgotten the
      subject (July 9, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Noverre's ballet, I only wrote that perhaps he would be making a new
      one. He just wanted half a ballet, and for that I provided the music; that
      is, there were six pieces by other people in it, consisting of poor,
      miserable French songs; I did the overture and contredanses, altogether
      about twelve pieces. The ballet has been performed four times with great
      applause.<a href="#linknote-19016" name="linknoteref-19016"
      id="linknoteref-19016"> 16 </a> But now I mean to do nothing without being
      sure beforehand what I am to get for it, for this was only as a good turn
      to Noverre.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such "good turns" were precisely what Noverre had in view. It suited
      him, as it did Le Gros, to have at command the services of a young artist
      eager to compose and ready to accept hope and patronage in lieu of
      payment, whose name it was not necessary to risk bringing before the
      public, since he was only employed as a stop-gap. But it would be a very
      different and far more serious thing for them to bring forward an original
      work, such as an opera, by this <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p048.png">[48]</a></span> same
      unknown young man. In case of failure the protectors would share the
      responsibilities of the <i>protÃ©gÃ©</i>, while success would bring fame and
      profit to the latter alone. Nothing shows more clearly Mozart's
      unsuspecting nature than his explanation of the long delay of his libretto
      (July 9, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always so with an opera. It is so hard to find a good poem; the old
      ones, which are the best, are not in the modern style, and the new ones
      are good for nothing; for poetry, which was the only thing the French had
      to be proud of, gets worse every day, and the poetry of the opera is just
      the part that must be good, for they do not understand the music. There
      are only two operas <i>in aria</i> which I could write&mdash;one in two
      acts, the other in three. The one in two acts is "Alexander and Roxane,"
      but the poet who is writing it is still in the country. That in three acts
      is "Demofoonte" (by Metastasio), translated and mixed with choruses and
      dances, and specially arranged for the French theatreÂ» and this I have not
      yet been able to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father saw through it all more plainly, and cautioned Wolfgang, if he
      wanted to succeed with an opera in Paris, to make himself known beforehand
      (August 27, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You must make a name for yourself. When did Gluck, when did Piccinni, when
      did all these people come forward? Gluck is not less than sixty, and it is
      twenty-six or twenty-seven years since he was first spoken of; and can you
      really imagine that the French public, or even the manager of the theatre,
      can be convinced of your powers of composition without having heard
      anything by you in their lives, or knowing you, except in your childhood
      as an excellent clavier-player and precocious genius? You must exert
      yourself, and make yourself known as a composer in every branch; make
      opportunities, and be indefatigable in making friends and in urging them
      on; wake them up when their energies slacken, and do not take for granted
      that they have done all they say they have. I should have written long ago
      to M. de Noverre if I had known his title and address.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this way of pushing his talents was completely foreign to Wolfgang's
      nature; and so it followed, in the natural course of things, that after a
      delay of months Noverre declared that he might be able to help him to a
      libretto, but could not insure the opera being performed when it was
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      One success, however, was to be granted him in Paris. He had naturally
      ceased to visit Le Gros since the latter <span class="side">PARISIAN
      SYMPHONY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p049.png">[49]</a></span>
      had so ruthlessly rejected his Sinfonie Concertante, but had been every
      day with Raaff, who lived in the same house. He had chanced to meet Le
      Gros there, who made the politest apologies, and begged him again to write
      a symphony for the Concert Spirituel. How could Mozart resist such a
      petition? On June 12 he took the symphony which he had just finished to
      Count Sickingen, where Raaff was. He continues:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both highly pleased. I myself am quite satisfied with it.
      Whether it will please generally I do not know; and, truth to say, I care
      very little; for whom have I to please? The <i>very few</i> intelligent
      Frenchmen that there are I can answer for; as for the stupid ones, it does
      not signify much whether they are pleased or not. But I am in hopes that
      even the donkeys will find something to admire. I have not omitted the <i>premier
      coup d'archet!</i>&mdash;and that is enough for them. What a fuss they
      make about that, to be sure! <i>Was Teufel!</i> I see no difference. They
      just begin together, as they do elsewhere. It is quite ludicrous.<a
      href="#linknote-19017" name="linknoteref-19017" id="linknoteref-19017"> 17
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The symphony pleased unusually, however, as he tells his father (July 3,
      1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was performed on Corpus Christi day with all applause. I hear that a
      notice of it has appeared in the "Courrier de l'Europe." I was very
      unhappy over the rehearsal, for I never heard anything worse in my life;
      you cannot imagine how they scraped and scrambled over the symphony twice.
      I was really unhappy; I should like to have rehearsed it again, but there
      are so many things, that there was no time. So I went to bed with a heavy
      heart and a discontented and angry spirit. The day before, I decided not
      to go to the concert; but it was a fine evening, and I determined at last
      to go, but with the intention, if it went as ill as at the rehearsal, of
      going into the orchestra, taking the violin out of the hands of M. La
      Houssaye, and conducting myself. I prayed for God's grace that it might go
      well, for it is all to His honour and glory; and, <i>ecce!</i> the
      symphony began. Raaff stood close to me, and <span class="side">PARIS,
      1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p050.png">[50]</a></span>
      in the middle of the first allegro was a passage that I knew was sure to
      please; the whole audience was struck, and there was great applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew when I was writing it that it would make an effect, so I brought it
      in again at the end, <i>da capo</i>. The andante pleased also, but
      especially the last allegro. I had heard that all the last allegros here,
      like the first, begin with all the instruments together, and generally in
      unison; so I began with the violins alone <i>piano</i> for eight bars,
      followed at once by a <i>forte</i>. The audience (as I had anticipated)
      cried "Hush!" at the <i>piano</i> but directly the <i>forte</i> began they
      took to clapping. As soon as the symphony was over I went into the
      Palais-Royal, took an ice, told my beads as I had vowed, and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      So brilliant a success was not wanting in more lasting results: "M. Le
      Qros has taken a tremendous fancy to me," he writes (July 9, 1778); and he
      was commissioned to write a French oratorio for performance at the Concert
      Spirituel during the following Lent:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My symphony was unanimously applauded; and Le Gros is so pleased with it
      that he calls it his best symphony.<a href="#linknote-19018"
      name="linknoteref-19018" id="linknoteref-19018"> 18 </a> Only the andante
      does not hit his taste; he says there are too many changes of key in it,
      and it is too long; but the real truth is that the audience forgot to clap
      their hands so loud as for the first and last movements; the andante is
      more admired than any other part by myself, and by all connoisseurs, as
      well as by the majority of the audience; it is just the contrary of what
      Le Gros says, being unaffected and short. But for his satisfaction (and
      that of others, according to him) I have written another. Either is good
      of its kind, for they differ greatly; perhaps, on the whole, I prefer the
      second one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symphony (297 K.), well known, by the name of the French or Parisian
      Symphony, was repeated with the new andante on August 15. It consists of
      three movements in the customary form, except that none of the parts are
      repeated entire, although they are perfectly distinct. This was a
      concession to the Parisian taste. Wolfgang writes to his father (September
      11, 1778) that his earlier symphonies would not please there: "We in
      Germany have a taste for lengthy performances, but in point of fact, it is
      better to be short and <span class="side">PARISIAN SYMPHONY.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p051.png">[51]</a></span> good," The
      first and last movements are unusually animated and restless, with an
      almost unbroken rapidity of movement; and the different subjects offer no
      contrasts as to character, being all in the same light, restless style.
      Thematic elaboration is only hinted at, except in the well worked-out
      middle movement of the finale. Melodies are scattered through the whole in
      great abundance, often connected with each other in a highly original and
      attractive manner. Suspense is kept up by strong contrasts of forte and
      piano, by sudden breaks and imperceptible modulations, and by striking
      harmonic effects. The general impression given by both movements is
      animated and brilliant, but they are more calculated to stir the intellect
      than to awaken the deeper emotions, and are therefore well suited to a
      Parisian audience. The same is the case with the tender and beautiful
      andante, which only now and then, surreptitiously as it were, betrays the
      existence of deep feeling. There are, as has been seen, two versions of
      the andante, both still existing in Mozart's handwriting&mdash;the second
      considerably shorter than the first. The leading part is minutely given
      throughout the score of the whole piece (which is marked andantino),
      besides a fixed subject being indicated for the bass, and in some places
      for the other instruments. After thus laying down, as it were, the ground
      plan, he proceeded to details, making few alterations beyond some slight
      abbreviations. When, in working out the movement, he came to a passage
      which seemed to him tedious or superfluous, he struck it out, and went on
      with the next. This has been the case with several unimportant passages,
      and with one longer one, a transition to the theme by means of an
      imitative passage (after page 36, bar 6, of the score); soon after, too, a
      middle passage with flute and oboe solos is cut out. After thus
      elaborating the movement, he hastily copied it all, as it is now printed.<a
      href="#linknote-19019" name="linknoteref-19019" id="linknoteref-19019"> 19
      </a> The later andante is printed in a Parisian edition of the symphony;<a

      1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p052.png">[52]</a></span>
      rightly rejected by Mozart. It is worthy of remark that the violoncello is
      employed as a leading instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestral workmanship shows that Mozart had not listened to the
      Mannheim band in vain; the different instruments form a well-ordered
      whole, in which each has its individual significance. It is only necessary
      to examine the thematic arrangement in the last movement (score, page 54)
      to perceive how skilfully the effect of varied tone-colouring is taken
      into account, while at the same time, by means of contrapuntal treatment,
      due prominence is given to the purely melodious element. It may well be
      imagined that Mozart would not let slip the opportunity of trying the
      splendid effect of a symphony with flutes, oboes, and clarinets (Vol. I.,
      p. 385). But the clarinets are sparely used as a foreign importation, and,
      together with the trumpets and drums, are altogether omitted from the
      andante. Large demands are made on the executive delicacy of the
      orchestra, and in many places the whole effect depends on a well-managed
      <i>crescendo</i>, as it had never done in previous works; in fact, it is
      not too much to say that many of the subjects would not have been
      conceived as they are, without the prospect of their performance by a
      well-organised orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this interval Mozart also completed the clavier sonatas, with
      violin accompaniment, which he had begun at Mannheim (301-306 K.), the
      fourth bearing the inscription "Ã¤ Paris," and busied himself to find a
      publisher for them who would pay him well.<a href="#linknote-19021"
      name="linknoteref-19021" id="linknoteref-19021"> 21 </a> He found leisure,
      also, to compose a capriccio for his sister's birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we see Mozart, disliking Paris and the Parisians, deriving little
      practical gain from all his exertions, and yet striving in his own way to
      attain the position which was his due, when an event occurred which
      plunged himself and his family into the deepest grief. Paris had never
      agreed with the Frau Mozart. Their lodging in the "HÃ¶tel des quatre fils
      d'Aymon," in the Rue du Gros-Chenet&mdash;a musical quarter <span
      class="side">DEATH OF MOZART'S MOTHER.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p053.png">[53]</a></span> &mdash;was bad, as well as the
      living, and she sat all day "as if under arrest," Wolfgang's affairs
      necessitating his almost constant absence. She was ill for three weeks in
      May, and intended, on her recovery, to seek out better lodgings, and
      manage the housekeeping herself. But in June she fell ill again; she was
      bled, and wrote afterwards to her husband (June 12, 1778) that she was
      very weak, and had pains in her arm and her eyes, but that on the whole
      she was better. But the improvement was only apparent, and her illness
      took a serious turn; the physician whom Grimm sent in gave up hope, and
      after a fortnight of the deepest anxiety, which Wolfgang passed at his
      mother's bedside, she gently passed away on July 3. His only support at
      this trying time was a musician named Heina, who had known his father in
      former days, and had often, with his wife, visited Frau Mozart in her
      solitude. Wolfgang's first thought was to break the news gently to his
      father, who was ill prepared for so crushing a blow. He wrote to him at
      once, saying that his mother was ill, and that her condition excited
      alarm; at the same time he acquainted their true friend Bullinger with the
      whole truth, and begged him to break the dreadful news to his father as
      gently as possible. In a few days, when he knew that this had been done,
      he wrote again himself in detail, offering all the consolation he could,
      and strove to turn his father's thoughts from the sad subject to the
      consideration of his own prospects. This letter<a href="#linknote-19022"

      example of the deep and tender love which bound parents and children
      together, and of Wolfgang's own sentiments and turn of mind. The
      consolations he offers, and the form in which he expresses them, are those
      of one who has himself passed through all the sad experiences of life; but
      to his father, whose teaching had tended to produce this effect, his
      expressions were justified and correct. With a natural and genuine sorrow
      for his irreparable loss is combined a manly composure, which sought not
      to obtain relief by indulging in sorrow, but to look forward calmly and
      steadily to the future and its duties.

    </p>
    <p>
      As a loving son, he set himself to the filial task of comforting and
      supporting his father. After hearing that the latter was aware of his
      wife's death, and resigned to God's will, Wolfgang answers (July 31,
      1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad as your letter made me, I was beyond measure pleased to find that you
      take everything in a right spirit, and that I need not be uneasy about my
      dear father and my darling sister. My impulse after reading your letter
      was to fall on my knees and thank God for His mercy. I am well and strong
      again now, and have only occasional fits of melancholy, for which the best
      remedy is writing or receiving letters&mdash;that restores my spirits
      again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, and with justice, that his father's anxiety on his account would
      now be redoubled. In keeping him informed of all his exertions and
      successes he satisfied his own longing to confide in his father, and gave
      the latter just that kind of interest and occupation of the mind which
      would serve to dispel his grief. It is touching to see the pains he takes
      to keep his father informed of all that he thinks will interest him, and
      how a certain irritability which had occasionally, and under the
      circumstances excusably, betrayed itself in his former letters, now
      completely disappears before the expression of tender affection: even the
      handwriting, which had been blamed as careless and untidy by his father,
      becomes neater and better. Trifles such as these are often the clearest
      expression of deep and refined feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the heavy blow fell, Wolfgang was alone, his Mannheim friends having
      left Paris; his father might well be apprehensive lest he should neglect
      the proper care of himself and his affairs. But Grimm now came forward;
      he, or more properly, as Mozart declares, his friend Madame D'Epinay,
      offered him an asylum in their house,<a href="#linknote-19023"
      name="linknoteref-19023" id="linknoteref-19023"> 23 </a> and a place at
      their table, and he willingly agreed, as soon as he was convinced that he
      should cause neither appreciable expense nor inconvenience. He soon found
      himself obliged occasionally to borrow small sums of Grimm, which
      gradually mounted <span class="side">MOZART AS GRIMM'S GUEST.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p055.png">[55]</a></span> "piecemeal" to
      fifteen louis-d'or; Grimm reassures the father by telling him that
      repayment may be indefinitely postponed. But Wolfgang soon found the way
      of life in Grimm's household not at all to his mind, and wrote of it as
      "stupid and dull." And, indeed, a greater contrast cannot well be imagined
      than when, from the house whence issued with scrupulous devotion bulletins
      of Voltaire's health, contradictory reports of his religious condition,
      and finally the announcement of his death (May 30, 1778), Wolfgang should
      write to his father (July 3, 1778): "I will tell you a piece of news,
      which perhaps you know already; that godless fellow and arch-scoundrel
      Voltaire is dead, like a dog, like a brute beast&mdash;that is his
      reward!" The condescending patronage with which he was treated soon became
      intolerable to him, and he complains of Grimm's way of furthering his
      interests in Paris as better fitted to a child than a grown man. We can
      well imagine that Grimm, like Mozart's own father, desired that he should
      make acquaintances, should gain access to distinguished families as a
      teacher and clavier-player, and should seek to win the favour of the
      fashion-leading part of the community; no doubt, too, Grimm felt it his
      duty to remonstrate openly with Wolfgang for what he considered his
      indolence and indifference. It is impossible to deny the good sense and
      proper appreciation of the position of all Grimm's remarks, but they were
      resented by Mozart on account of the tone of superiority with which they
      were enforced. Grimm was indeed openly opposed to Mozart, and told him
      frankly that he would never succeed in Paris&mdash;he was not active, and
      did not go about enough; and he wrote the same thing to Wolfgang's father.<a

      href="pgimages/p056.png">[56]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became apparent that Grimm was not really of opinion that Mozart's
      talents were of such an order as to offer him a career in Paris; he said
      that he could not believe that Wolfgang would be able to write a French
      opera likely to succeed, and referred him for instruction to the Italians.
      "He is always wanting me," writes Mozart (September 11, 1778), "to follow
      Piccinni or Caribaldi (Vol. I., p. 77), in fact, he belongs to the foreign
      party&mdash;he is false&mdash;and tries to put me down in every way." He
      longed above all things to write an opera to show Grimm "that I can do as
      much as his dear Piccinni, although I am only a German." Grimm's character
      was not a simple one;<a href="#linknote-19025" name="linknoteref-19025"
      id="linknoteref-19025"> 25 </a> he had both won and kept for himself under
      adverse circumstances an influential position, which was no easy matter in
      Paris at any time. Queer stories were told of him,<a href="#linknote-19026"
      name="linknoteref-19026" id="linknoteref-19026"> 26 </a> and his love of
      truth was not implicitly relied on.<a href="#linknote-19027"
      name="linknoteref-19027" id="linknoteref-19027"> 27 </a> Rousseau
      describes him as perfidious and egotistical. Madame D'Epinay, on the other
      hand, extols him as a disinterested friend, and others speak of his
      benevolence and ready sympathy.<a href="#linknote-19028"
      name="linknoteref-19028" id="linknoteref-19028"> 28 </a> There is, at any
      rate, no reason to suspect that he meant otherwise than well by Mozart,
      although he did not appreciate his genius, and interested himself more for
      the father's sake than the son's. He had striven for years to assert the
      supremacy of Italian music, and his ideal was Italian opera performed in
      Paris by Italian singers in the Italian language. When De Vismes, who was
      anxious to propitiate all parties, engaged a company of Italian <span
      class="side">STUDY OF FRENCH OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p057.png">[57]</a></span> singers,<a href="#linknote-19029"
      name="linknoteref-19029" id="linknoteref-19029"> 29 </a> Grimm hailed the
      auspicious day on which Caribaldi, Baglioni, and Chiavacci appeared in
      Piccinni's "Finte Gemelle" (June n, 1778).<a href="#linknote-19030"
      name="linknoteref-19030" id="linknoteref-19030"> 30 </a> It is therefore
      quite conceivable that he renounced all interest in Mozart's artistic
      future as soon as he was convinced of his falling off from purely Italian
      notions, and it is interesting to us to have so clear an indication that
      even thus early in his career Mozart had set himself in opposition to the
      Italian school. He had long since learnt all that it had to teach, and he
      fully recognised the fact that it was his mission to carry on the reform
      set on foot by Gluck and GrÃ©try, at the same time retaining all that was
      valuable in the Italian teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      A confirmation of this is found in a later expression of opinion made by
      Mozart to Joseph Frank, who found him engaged in the study of French
      scores, and asked him if it would not be better to devote himself to
      Italian compositions; whereupon Mozart answered: "As far as melody is
      concerned, yes; but as far as dramatic effect is concerned, no; besides,
      the scores which you see here are by Gluck, Piccinni, Salieri, as well as
      GrÃ©try, and have nothing French but the words."<a href="#linknote-19031"
      name="linknoteref-19031" id="linknoteref-19031"> 31 </a> This view was
      confirmed by his stay in Paris, a stay quite as fruitful for his artistic
      development as that at Mannheim had been. Grimm's accounts show that
      Mozart had opportunities for hearing the operas of numerous French
      composers. Besides Gluck's "Armide" which was still new, "Orpheus,"
      "Alceste," and "Iphigenia in Aulis," which had been revived, Piccinni's
      "Roland," GrÃ¨try's "Matroco," "Les Trois Ages de l'OpÃ©ra," and "Le
      Jugement de Midas" were given, as well as Philidor's "Ernelinde,"
      Dezaide's "Zulima," Gossec's "FÃªte du Village," Rousseau's "Devin du
      Village." Added to these were Piccinni's Italian opera "Le Finte Gemelle,"
      and doubtless many others of which we know nothing. It may well excite
      wonder that Mozart's letters to his father describe <span class="side">PARIS,
      1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p058.png">[58]</a></span>
      none of the new artistic impressions which he must have received in Paris.
      But, apart from the fact that personal affairs naturally held the first
      place in his home correspondence, it must be remembered that abstract
      reflections on art and its relation to individual artists were not at that
      time the fashion, and were besides quite foreign to Mozart's nature. His
      aesthetic remarks and judgments whether they treated of technical
      questions or of executive effects, are mostly founded on concrete
      phenomena. The practical directness of his productive power, set in motion
      by every impulse of his artistic nature, prevented his fathoming the
      latest psychical conditions of artistic activity, or tracing the delicate
      threads which connect the inner consciousness of the artist with his
      external impressions, or analysing the secret processes of the soul which
      precede the production of a work of art. He does not seem any more
      actively conscious of the effect wrought upon him by the works of others.
      Some men's impressions of a great work are involuntary, and they seek
      later to comprehend the grounds of their enjoyment; others strive
      consciously to grasp the idea of the work and to incorporate it into their
      being; but to the man of creative genius alone is it given to preserve his
      own totality while absorbing all that is good in the works of other
      artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without ever losing his own individuality, an artist of true genius
      absorbs impressions from nature and from other works of art than his own,
      and constructs them anew from his inner consciousness. He accepts and
      assimilates whatever is calculated to nourish his formative power, and
      rejects with intuitive right judgment all that is foreign to his nature.
      Just as in the production of a true work of art invention and labour,
      inspiration and execution, willing and doing, are inseparably interwoven,
      so in the consideration by a genius of the works of other men and other
      ages, delighted appreciation is combined with criticism, ready
      apprehension collects materials for original work in its truest sense; it
      is a natural process, which perfects itself in the mind of the artist
      without any conscious action on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the judgment that one artist pronounces on <span class="side">RESULT.
      OF STAY IN PARIS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p059.png">[59]</a></span>
      another is not always in perfect accord with the influence which has been
      brought to bear on himself by that other. The deeper the influence
      penetrates into the roots of an artist's inner being, the more will it
      become part and parcel of his productive powers, and the consciousness of
      any outside influence will be rapidly lost. It remains for future
      historical inquirers to ascertain and define the influence of the
      intellectual current of the age on the individual, and the mutual action
      on each other of exceptional phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small as the visible results of Mozart's stay in Paris might be, and far
      as he remained from the object with which he had undertaken the journey,
      it yet enabled him, with great gain to his progress as an artist, to free
      himself from the Italian school, after such a thorough study of its
      principles as convinced him of the value of the element of dramatic
      construction which lay concealed in it. It may indeed be considered as a
      fortunate circumstance that no sooner had this conviction taken root in
      him than he turned his back on party disputes and left the place which was
      of all others the least fitted to encourage the quiet steady progress of
      genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart had other and very different reasons for wishing to shorten
      Wolfgang's stay in Paris as much as he had hitherto desired to prolong it.
      With his wife's death he had lost the assurance that Wolfgang's life in
      Paris would be of no detriment to his moral nature. Indulgent as she had
      been to her son, in this respect her influence was unbounded; and now it
      might be feared that Wolfgang's easy-going nature would lead him into bad
      company. Grimm's account convinced him that Wolfgang had no prospects of
      success in Paris, the less so as he took no pains to conceal his dislike
      of the place. His dearest wish at this time was to be appointed
      Kapellmeister to the Elector of Bavaria; he hoped thus to be able to
      improve the position of the Weber family, and to claim Aloysia as his own.
      The project was not disapproved of by his father (who, however, was told
      nothing of the last item); on the contrary, he wrote to Padre Martini
      describing the state of affairs, and earnestly <span class="side">PARIS,
      1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p060.png">[60]</a></span>
      requesting him directly and through Raaff to gain the Elector for
      Wolfgang; this the Padre readily undertook. As for Raaff, his friendship
      for Mozart and the interest which he took in Aloysia Weber were incentives
      enough for exertion, and Mozart had other influential friends among the
      musicians, besides being able to count on the support of Count Sickingen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Munich especially, where there was no German operatic composer of merit&mdash;Holzbauer
      being too old to have much influence&mdash;the need of a kapellmeister and
      composer was strongly felt; but the circumstances were very unfavourable.
      After it had been finally decided that the court should be removed from
      Mannheim to Munich, and all had been prepared for the move, threatenings
      of war threw everything into confusion again. Wolfgang felt this a heavy
      blow to the interests of the Webers, concerning whom he writes to his
      father (July 31, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before yesterday my dear friend Weber wrote to me, among other
      things, that the day after the Elector's arrival it was announced that he
      intended to take up his residence at Munich. This news came like a
      thunderbolt to Mannheim, and the joy which had been testified by the
      illuminations of the day before was suddenly extinguished (p. 404). The
      court musicians were all informed that they were at liberty to follow the
      court to Munich, or to remain in Mannheim with their present salary; each
      one was to send in his written and sealed decision to the Intendant within
      fourteen days. Weber, whose miserable circumstances you know, wrote as
      follows: "My decayed circumstances put it out of my power to follow my
      gracious master to Munich, however earnestly I may wish to do so." Before
      this happened there was a grand concert at court, and poor Mdlle. Weber
      felt her enemies' malice; she was not invited to sing&mdash;no one knows
      why. Immediately afterwards was a concert at Herr von Gemmingen's, and
      Count Seeau was present. She sang two of my songs, and was fortunate
      enough to please, in spite of the wretched foreigners (the Munich
      singers). She is much injured by these infamous slanderers, who say that
      her singing is deteriorating. But Cannabich, when the songs were over,
      said to her, "Mademoiselle, I hope that you will go on deteriorating after
      this fashion! I will write to Herr Mozart to-morrow, and acquaint him with
      your success." As the matter now stands, if war had not broken out, the
      court would have removed to Munich; Count Seeau, who positively <i>will
      have Mdlle. Weber</i>, had arranged everything so as to take her, and
      there was hope that the circumstances of the whole family would improve in
      <span class="side">PROSPECTS IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p061.png">[61]</a></span> consequence. But now the Munich
      journey is no more talked of, and the unfortunate Webers may have to wait
      here long enough, their debts growing heavier day by day. If I could only
      help them! My dear father, I recommend them to you with my whole heart. If
      they had only 1,000 florins a year to depend upon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon his father reminds him that his anxiety about the Webers is
      unbecoming, as long as he does not bestow the same care on himself and his
      own family (August 27, 1778). Besides there was no prospect for him in
      Munich at present, and his father therefore wished him to remain in Paris,
      at all events until the matter was decided.<a href="#linknote-19032"
      name="linknoteref-19032" id="linknoteref-19032"> 32 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this uncertainty a favourable prospect opened in Salzburg
      itself. Since Adlgasser's death it had become more and more evident at
      court that Wolfgang's recall would be of all things most advantageous; it
      was signified to L. Mozart through Bullinger that, as he doubtless wished
      to retain his son near him, the court would be prepared to give him a
      monthly salary of fifty florins as organist and concertmeister, and he
      might look forward with certainty to being made kapellmeister; but the
      Archbishop could not make the first advances. Bullinger duly performed his
      mission, but L. Mozart, who well knew the perplexity the Archbishop was
      in, required that the proposition should be made direct to him. So,
      therefore, it was obliged to be; and the diplomatic skill, "worthy of a
      Ulysses" as Wolfgang says, with which L. Mozart contrived to hold his
      ground and to avail himself of his strong position in an interview with
      the canon, Count Joseph Stahremberg, is minutely described by himself
      (June 29, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When I arrived no one was there but his brother the major, who is staying
      with him to recover from the fright into which he has been thrown by
      Prussian powder and shot. He told me that an organist had been recommended
      to him, but he would not accept him without being sure that he was good.
      He wished to know if I was acquainted with him&mdash;Mandl, or some such
      name, he did not remember what. "Oh, you stupid fellow!" thought I; "is it
      likely that an order or a request should be received from Vienna with
      reference to a candidate whose <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p062.png">[62]</a></span> name is
      not even mentioned." As if I could not guess that all this was by way of
      inducing me to mention my son! But not I! no, not a syllable. I said I had
      not the honour of knowing any such person, and that I would never venture
      to recommend any one to our prince, since it would be difficult to find
      any one who would altogether suit him. "Yes," said he, "I cannot recommend
      him any one; it is far too difficult! Your son should be here now!"
      "Bravo! the bait has taken," thought I; "what a pity that this man is not
      a minister of state or an ambassador!" Then I said, "We will speak
      plainly. Is it not the case that all possible measures were taken to drive
      my son out of Salzburg?" I began at the beginning and enumerated every
      past circumstance, so that his brother was quite astonished, but he
      himself could not deny the truth of a single point, and at length told his
      brother that young Mozart had been the wonder of all who came to Salzburg.
      He wanted to persuade me to write to my son; but I said that I would not
      do so&mdash;it would be labour in vain, for that unless I could tell him
      what income he might expect, my son would laugh at the proposition;
      Adlgasser's salary would be totally insufficient. Indeed, even if his
      Grace the Archbishop were to offer him fifty florins a-month, it would be
      doubtful whether he would accept it. We all three left the house together,
      for they were going to the riding-school, and I accompanied them. We spoke
      on the subject all the way, and I held to what I had said; he held to my
      son as the only candidate for him. The fact is, that the Archbishop can
      hear of no other good organist who is also a good clavier-player; he says
      now (but only to his favourites) that BeeckÃ© was a charlatan and a
      buffoon, and that Mozart excels all others; he would rather have him whom
      he knows than some one else highly paid whom he does not know. He cannot
      promise any one (as he would have to do if he gave a smaller salary) an
      income by pupils, since there are but few, and those are mine, I having
      the name of giving as good lessons as any man. Here then is the affair in
      full swing. I do not write, my dear Wolfgang, with the intention of
      inducing you to return to Salzburg, for I place no reliance on the words
      of the Archbishop, and I have not yet spoken to his sister the Countess;<a
      href="#linknote-19033" name="linknoteref-19033" id="linknoteref-19033"> 33
      </a> I rather avoided the opportunity of meeting her; for she would take
      the least word as consent and petition. They must come to me, and if
      anything is to be done, I must have a clear and advantageous proposal
      made, which can hardly be expected. We must wait, and hold fast to our
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfgang, who disliked Salzburg more even than Paris, at first took no
      notice of all this. But the death of the old kapellmeister Lolli,
      coinciding with that of his mother, brought <span class="side">MOZART'S
      DISLIKE OF SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p063.png">[63]</a></span> matters in Salzburg to a crisis,
      and under the circumstances L. Mozart was more than ever convinced that
      Wolfgang should have a good position there. Good old Bullinger was again
      employed as a mediator to reconcile Wolfgang to the idea. He wrote to his
      young friend that he would be wronging his family by refusing so
      advantageous a position as that now offered to him, and that life might be
      endurable even in so small a place as Salzburg. He mentioned casually that
      the Archbishop intended engaging a new singer, and hints that his choice
      might be turned towards Aloysia Weber. Thereupon Wolfgang wrote candidly
      to Bullinger (August 7, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You know how hateful Salzburg is to me!&mdash;not alone on account of the
      unjust treatment received there by both my father and myself&mdash;though
      that in itself is enough to make one wish to wipe the place clean out of
      one's memory. But even supposing that things turned out so that we could
      live <i>well</i>&mdash;living <i>well</i> and living <i>happily</i> are
      two things, and the latter I should never be able to do without the aid of
      magic&mdash;it would be against the natural order of things! It would be
      the greatest pleasure to me to embrace my dear father and sister, and the
      sooner the better; but I cannot deny that my joy would be doubled if the
      reunion took place anywhere but in Salzburg. I should have far more hope
      of living happily and contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes on to explain that it is not because Salzburg is small that he
      dreads returning to it, but because it offers no field for his talent,
      music being but little esteemed there; he remarks with bitter satire how
      the Archbishop pretends to seek with much parade for a kapellmeister and a
      prima donna, and in reality does nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his father gives him further information as to the position of
      affairs (August 27, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have written to you already that your recall here is desired, and they
      beat about the bush with me for a long time without getting me to commit
      myself; until at last, after Lolli's death, I was obliged to tell the
      Countess that I had addressed a petition to the Archbishop, which,
      however, simply appealed to his favour by drawing attention to my long and
      uncomplaining services. The conversation then turned upon you, and I
      expressed myself as frankly upon all necessary points as I had previously
      done to Count Stahremberg. At last she asked me whether you would come if
      the Archbishop were to give me Lolli's post, and you Adlgasser's, which,
      as I had already calculated, would bring us in <span class="side">PARIS,
      1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p064.png">[64]</a></span>
      together one thousand florins a year; I could do nothing else but answer
      that I had no doubt that if this happened you would consent for love of
      me, especially as the Countess declared that there was not the least doubt
      that the Archbishop would allow you to travel in Italy every second year,
      since he himself had said how important it was to hear something new from
      time to time, and that he would furnish you with good letters of
      introduction. If this were to happen, we might reckon securely on one
      hundred and fifteen florins a month; and, as things now are, on more than
      one hundred and twenty florins. We should be better off than in any other
      place where living is twice as dear, and, not having to look so closely
      after money, we should be able to think more of amusement. But I am far
      from thinking the affair a certainty, for I know how hard such a decision
      will be to the Archbishop. You have the entire goodwill and sympathy of
      the Countess, that is certain; and it is equally certain that old Arco,
      Count Stahremberg, and the Bishop of Konigsgratz, are all anxious to bring
      the matter to a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are reasons, as is always the case; and, as I have always told
      you, the Countess and old Arco are afraid of my leaving also. They have no
      one to succeed me as a clavier-teacher: I have the name of teaching well&mdash;and,
      indeed, the proofs are there. They know of no one; and, should a teacher
      come from Vienna, is it likely that he would give lessons for four florins
      or a ducat the dozen, when anywhere else he would have two or three
      ducats? This sets them all in perplexity. But, as I have said before, I do
      not reckon on it, because I know the Archbishop. It may be true that he
      sincerely wishes to secure you; but he cannot make up his mind, especially
      when it concerns <i>giving</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably Wolfgang counted on this fact, and refrained on that account from
      treating the matter seriously. Just at this time his discomfort in Paris
      was lightened by a pleasant event. His old London friend Bach, (Vol. I.,
      p. 39), had been invited to write an opera ("Amadis") for Paris. "The
      French are asses, and always will be," remarks Wolfgang thereupon (July 9,
      1778); "they can do nothing themselves, but are obliged to have recourse
      to foreigners. Bach came to Paris to make the necessary arrangements, and
      Wolfgang wrote (August 27, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Bach has been in Paris for the last fortnight. He is going to write a
      French opera. He has come to hear the singers; then he goes back to
      London, writes the opera, and returns to put it on the stage.<a
      href="#linknote-19034" name="linknoteref-19034" id="linknoteref-19034"> 34
      </a> You may imagine his joy and mine at our meeting. Perhaps mine is
      <span class="side">SUMMONS TO SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p065.png">[65]</a></span> more sincere, but it must be
      acknowledged that he is an honest man, and does people justice. I love
      him, as you know, from my heart, and have a high esteem for him. As for
      him, he does not flatter or exaggerate as some do, but both to myself and
      others he praises me seriously and sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bach had introduced Wolfgang to the Marshal de Noailles,<a
      href="#linknote-19035" name="linknoteref-19035" id="linknoteref-19035"> 35
      </a> and the latter had invited them both, as well as Bach's "bosom
      friend" Tenducci (Vol. I., p. 41), to St. Germain. There they spent some
      pleasant days together, and it need hardly be said that Mozart composed a
      scena for Tenducci, with pianoforte, oboe, horn, and bassoon
      accompaniment, the instruments being taken by dependents of the Marshal,
      chiefly Germans, who played well.<a href="#linknote-19036"
      name="linknoteref-19036" id="linknoteref-19036"> 36 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the time for decision drew near. The Salzburg authorities had
      made a definite proposal to L. Mozart, as he had wished, and he wrote to
      his son in a way which hardly left him a choice (August 31, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not like Paris, and I scarcely think you are wrong. My heart and
      mind have been troubled for you until now, and I have been obliged to play
      a very ticklish part, concealing my anxiety under the semblance of
      light-heartedness, in order to give the impression that you were in the
      best of circumstances and had money in abundance, although I well knew to
      the contrary. I was very doubtful of gaining my point because, as you
      know, the step we took and your hasty resignation left us little to hope
      from our haughty Archbishop. But my clever management has carried me
      through, and the Archbishop has agreed to all my terms, both for you and
      myself. You are to have five hundred florins, and he expressed regret at
      not being able to make you kapellmeister at once. You are to be allowed to
      act as my deputy when the work is beyond me, or I am unfit to do it. He
      said he had always intended to give you a better post, &amp;c.; in fact,
      to my amazement, he made the politest apologies. More than that! he has
      given five florins additional to Paris,<a href="#linknote-19037"
      name="linknoteref-19037" id="linknoteref-19037"> 37 </a> so that he may
      take the heaviest duties, and enable you to act as concertmeister again.
      So that <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p066.png">[66]</a></span> we shall get altogether, as I
      told you before, an income of one thousand florins. Now I should like to
      know whether you think my head is worth anything, and whether or not I
      have done my best for you. I have thought of everything. The Archbishop
      has declared himself prepared to let you travel where you will, if you
      want to write an opera. He apologised for his refusal last year by saying
      that he could not bear his subjects to go about begging. Now Salzburg is a
      middle point between Munich, Vienna, and Italy. It will be easier to get a
      commission for an opera in Munich than to get an official post, for German
      composers are scarce. The Elector's death has put a stop to all
      appointments, and war is breaking out again. The Duke of
    </p>
    <p>
      ZweibrÃ¼cken<a href="#linknote-19038" name="linknoteref-19038"
      id="linknoteref-19038"> 38 </a> is no great lover of music. But I would
      rather you did not leave Paris until I have the signed agreement in my
      hand. The Prince and the whole court are wonderfully taken with Mdlle.
      Weber, and are absolutely determined to hear her. She must stay with us.
      Her father seems to me to have no head. I will manage the affair for them
      if they choose to follow my advice. You must speak the word for her here,
      for there is another singer wanted for operatic performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now so sure of the affair that he concluded his letter with the
      words, "My next letter will tell you when to set off."
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart was not mistaken in his son; however great the sacrifice it
      entailed upon him, he prepared to yield to the will of his father. "When I
      read your letter," he answered (September 11, 1778), "I trembled with joy,
      for I felt myself already in your embrace. It is true, as you will
      acknowledge, that it is not much of a prospect for me; but when I look
      forward to seeing you, and embracing my dearest sister, I think of no
      other prospect." He did not conceal from his father his repugnance to the
      idea of a residence at Salzburg, on account of the want of congenial
      society, the unmusical tone of the place, and the little confidence placed
      by the Archbishop in sensible and cultivated people. His consolation was
      the permission to travel, without which he would hardly have made up his
      mind to come. "A man of mediocre talent remains mediocre whether he
      travels or not; but a man of superior talent (which I cannot without
      hypocrisy deny myself to be) becomes bad if he always remains in the same
      place." The possibility that Aloysia Weber might come to Salzburg <span
      class="side">ENCOURAGEMENT FROM L. MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p067.png">[67]</a></span> filled him with joy; for, indeed,
      if the Archbishop really wanted a prima donna, he could not have a better
      one. He is already troubled by the thought "that if people come from
      Salzburg for the Carnival, and 'Rosamund' is played, poor Mdlle. Weber
      will perhaps not please, or at least will not be judged of as she
      deserves, for she has a wretched part&mdash;almost a <i>persona muta</i>&mdash;to
      sing a few bars between the choruses" (Vol. I., p. 403). "When I am in
      Salzburg," he continues, "I shall certainly not fail to intercede with all
      zeal for my dear friend; and in the meantime I earnestly hope you will do
      your best for her&mdash;you cannot give your son any greater pleasure." He
      begs for permission to take Mannheim on his way home, in order to visit
      the Webers.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart, knowing how deep and well-founded an antipathy Wolfgang had for
      Salzburg, sought to convince him that he would find himself in a much
      better position there now than formerly. "Our assured income," he wrote
      (September 3, 1778), "is what I have written to you, and your mode of life
      will not come in the way of your studies and any other work. You are not
      to play the violin at court, but you have full power of direction at the
      clavier." This was an important point to Wolfgang, and his father recurs
      to it again (September 24, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly you were really nothing but a violinist, and that only as
      concertmeister; now you are concertmeister and court organist, and your
      chief duty is to accompany at the clavier. You will not think it any
      disgrace to play the violin as an <i>amateur</i> in the first symphony,
      since you will do it in company with the Archbishop himself, and all the
      court nobility. Herr Haydn is a man whose musical merit you will readily
      acknowledge&mdash;should you stigmatise him as a "court fiddler" because,
      in his capacity as concertmeister, he plays the viola in the smaller
      concerts? It is all by way of amusement; and I would lay a wager that,
      rather than hear your compositions bungled, you would set to yourself with
      a will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He consoles him also by reminding him that the concerts at court are
      short, from seven o'clock to a quarter past eight, and that seldom more
      than four pieces are performed&mdash;a symphony, an aria, a symphony or
      concerto, and another aria (September 17, 1778). Since the <span
      class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p068.png">[68]</a></span> payment of their debts did not
      press, they could pay off annually a few hundred gulden, and live easily
      and comfortably. "You will find amusement enough here; for when one has
      not to look at every kreutzer, it makes many things possible. We can go to
      all the balls at the Town-Hall during the Carnival. The Munich theatrical
      company are to come at the end of September, and to remain here the whole
      winter with comedies and operettas. Then there is our quoit-playing every
      Sunday, and if we choose to go into society it will come to us; everything
      is altered when one has a better income." But the father knew that the
      point on which Wolfgang would be most open to persuasion was not the
      prospect of Salzburg gaieties, but that of a union with his beloved Mdlle.
      Weber; and he goes on to speak on this subject too. Not only does he say,
      "You will soon be asked about Mdlle. Weber when you are here; I have
      praised her continually, and I will do all I can to gain her a hearing,"
      but he continues: "As to Mdlle. Weber, you must not imagine that I
      disapprove of the acquaintance. All young people must make fools of
      themselves. You are welcome to continue your correspondence without
      interference from me. Nay, more! I will give you a piece of advice. Every
      one knows you here. You had better address your letters to Mdlle. Weber
      under cover to some one else, and receive them in the same way, unless you
      think my prudence a sufficient safeguard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The paternal permission to make a fool of himself was calculated to hurt
      the lover's tenderest feelings, and he does not disguise that this is the
      case in narrating a proof of the genuine attachment of the Webers for him.
      "The poor things," he writes (October 15, 1778), "were all in great
      anxiety on my account. They thought I was dead, not having heard from me
      for a whole month, owing to the loss of a letter; they were confirmed in
      their opinion because of a report in Mannheim that my dear mother had died
      of an infectious illness. They all prayed for my soul, and the dear girl
      went every day to the church of the Capucins. You will laugh, no doubt?
      but not I; it touches me; I cannot help it." About the same time he
      received the news <span class="side">ALOYSIA WEBER AT MUNICH.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p069.png">[69]</a></span> that Aloysia
      had obtained an operatic engagement at Munich with a good salary,<a
      href="#linknote-19039" name="linknoteref-19039" id="linknoteref-19039"> 39
      </a> and he expresses the mingled feelings with which he heard it simply
      and truly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am as pleased at Mdlle. Weber's, or rather at my dear Aloysia's
      appointment as any one who has taken such a warm interest in her affairs
      was sure to be; but I can no longer expect the fulfilment of my earnest
      wish that she should settle in Salzburg, for the Archbishop would never
      give her what she is to have in Munich. All I can hope for is that she
      will sometimes come to Salzburg to sing in operas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turn in affairs must have strengthened Mozart's secret wish to obtain
      an appointment under the Elector of Bavaria, and his determination to do
      all he could towards this end on his journey through Mannheim and Munich,
      and to "turn a cold shoulder" on the Archbishop. His father had nothing to
      oppose to such a project except the uncertainty of its prospects; he
      sought, therefore, to convince Wolfgang that his only right course now was
      to accept the certainty offered to him, and to keep Munich in view for a
      future time. He gave him definite instructions on the point (September 3,
      1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Electoral Court is expected in Munich on September 15, you can
      speak yourself to your friend Count Seeau, and perhaps to the Elector
      himself on your journey through. You can say that your father wishes you
      to return to Salzburg, and that the Prince has offered you a salary of
      seven or eight hundred florins (add on two or three hundred) as
      concertmeister; that you have accepted it from filial duty to your father,
      although you know he has always wished to see you in the electoral
      service. But, N.B., no more than this! You may want to write an opera in
      Munich, and you can do so best from here; it cannot fail to be so, for
      German operatic composers are very scarce. Schweitzer and Holzbauer will
      not write every year; and should Michl write one, he will soon be
      out-Michled. Should there be those who throw doubts and difficulties in
      the way, you have friends in the profession who will stand up for you; and
      this court will also bring out something during the year. In short you
      will be at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now quite necessary that Wolfgang should leave Paris; and in
      anticipating what he had to expect in Salzburg, he began to feel what he
      was leaving in Paris. He <span class="side">PARIS, 1778.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p070.png">[70]</a></span> was angry with
      Grimm, who desired that he should be ready for his journey in a week,
      which was impossible, since he had still claims on the Duc de Guines and
      on Le Gros, and must wait to correct the proofs of his sonatas, and to
      sell the compositions he had with him.<a href="#linknote-19040"
      name="linknoteref-19040" id="linknoteref-19040"> 40 </a> He had no small
      desire to write six more trios, for which he might expect good payment.
      Grimm's evident wish that he should go, and his offer to pay the journey
      to Strasburg (which seemed to the father a proof of friendship) was
      considered by Wolfgang as distrust and insincerity. Grimm no doubt wished
      to be relieved of the responsibility he had undertaken as soon as
      possible, and may have offended his <i>protÃ©gÃ©</i> by too open an
      expression of his desire; but there is no doubt that he acted according to
      the mind of the father, and in the sincere opinion that the unpractical
      and vacillating young man required decided treatment. But Wolfgang was so
      firmly convinced that his departure from Paris was premature, that he
      wrote to his father from Strasburg (October 15, 1778), that it was the
      greatest folly in the world to go to Salzburg now, and only his love to
      his father had induced him to set aside the representations of his
      friends. He had been praised for this, but with the remark that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If my father had known my present good circumstances and prospects, and
      had not believed the reports of certain false friends, he would not have
      written to me in a way that I could not withstand. And I think myself that
      if I had not been so annoyed in the house where I was staying, and if the
      whole thing had not come upon me like a thunderbolt, so that there was no
      time to consider it in cool blood, I should certainly have begged you to
      have a little more patience, and to leave me in Paris; I assure you I
      should have gained both money and fame, and been able to extricate you
      from all your embarrassments. But it <span class="side">STRASBURG, 1778.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p071.png">[71]</a></span> is done
      now. Do not imagine that I repent the step, for only you, my dear father,
      only you can sweeten for me the bitterness of Salzburg, and we shall do it&mdash;I
      know we shall; but I must frankly own that I should come to Salzburg with
      a lighter heart if I did not know that I was to be in the service of the
      court. The idea is intolerable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime business was wound up, the mother's property and the heavy
      baggage was sent direct to Salzburg; and on September 26 Wolfgang left
      Paris, having gained much experience but little satisfaction, as depressed
      and out of humour as he had entered it.

      CHAPTER XX. THE RETURN HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WOLFGANG'S father expected that he<span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p071.png">[71]</a></span> would perform his homeward journey
      without any unnecessary delay, and his anxiety became serious when day
      after day passed and he received no tidings of his son's approach to
      Strasburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confessed and communicated together with your sister," he writes
      (October 19, 1778), "and earnestly prayed for your preservation; good old
      Bullinger prayed for you daily in the holy mass." The fact was, that
      instead of providing Mozart with means to travel by the diligence, which
      accomplished the journey to Strasburg in a week, Grimm had satisfied
      himself with an ordinary conveyance, which occupied twelve days on the
      road. Mozart's patience was tired out in a week, and he halted at Nancy.
      Here he met with a German merchant, the best man in the world, who at once
      conceived a paternal attachment for him, and wept at the idea of their
      parting. With this new friend Wolfgang, determined to travel to Strasburg
      as soon as an opportunity of doing so cheaply should occur. They were
      obliged to wait a considerable time, and it was the middle of October
      before they reached Strasburg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Things are not promising here; but the day after to-morrow (Saturday,
      October 17) I intend, <i>quite alone</i> (to avoid expense), to give a
      subscription concert to certain friends and connoisseurs; if I had engaged
      any other instruments it would, with the lighting, have cost me more than
      three louis-d'or; and who knows if it will bring in so much?
    </p>

      It was a shrewd guess, <span class="side">THE RETURN HOME.</span>
      <span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p072.png">[72]</a></span>for his next letter had to announce three
      louis-d'or as the exact sum made by this "little model of a concert":&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the principal receipts were in "bravos" and "bravissimos," which
      resounded from all sides. Prince Max of ZweibrÃ¼cken, too, honoured the
      concert with his presence. I need scarcely say that every one was pleased.
      I should have left Strasburg immediately after this, but I was advised to
      stay until the following Saturday, and give a grand concert in the
      theatre. At this I made the identical same sum, to the amazement and
      indignation and shame of all Strasburg. I must say, however, that my ears
      ached as much from the applauding and hand-clapping as if the theatre had
      been crammed full. Every one present openly and loudly denounced the
      conduct of their fellow-townsmen; and I told them all that if I could have
      imagined that I should have so small an audience, I would gladly have
      given the concert gratis, for the pleasure of seeing the theatre full.
      Indeed, I should have preferred it; for nothing can be more dismal than to
      lay a table for eighty guests and receive only three&mdash;and then it was
      so cold! But I soon grew warm; and in order to show my gentlemen of
      Strasburg that I was not put out, I played a great deal for my own
      entertainment; I gave them a concerto more than I had promised, and
      improvised for a long time at the end. Well, it is over and done with, and
      at least I have gained the reputation and honour.

      Besides the concerts, he played publicly on the two best of Silbermann's
      organs in the Neue Kirche and the Thomas Kirche, and the roads being
      flooded and his departure for the present impossible, he resolved to give
      another concert on his fÃªte-day, October 31. This he did at the
      solicitation and for the gratification of his friends Frank, De Beyer,
      &amp;c., and the result was&mdash;<i>one</i> louis-d'or. No wonder that he
      was obliged to raise money in order to continue his journey, a fact which
      he remembered years after with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the advice of friends who had made the journey he continued his way by
      diligence via Mannheim; the better roads and more comfortable carriage
      amply compensating for the <i>dÃ©tour</i>. At Mannheim he alighted on
      November 6, and was welcomed with acclamations by his friends. The journey
      viÃ¤ Mannheim seemed to Leopold Mozart a most senseless proceeding on
      Wolfgang's part; the Weber family and all his best friends had migrated to
      Munich, and there was nothing to be gained by the visit.

      He stayed with Madame Cannabich, who had not yet left, and who was never
      tired of hearing about himself; all his acquaintance tore him in pieces,
      for "as I love Mannheim, so Mannheim loves me." The old associations woke
      in him the old hopes and wishes. The Mannheim people were anxious to
      believe that the Elector could not stand the coarse manners of the
      Bavarians, and would soon be tired of Munich. It was reported that Madame
      Toscani and Madame Urban had been so hissed that the Elector had leant
      over his box and cried "Hush!" As this had no effect, Count Seeau had
      begged some officers not to make so much noise, since it displeased the
      Elector; but they answered, that they had paid for their admission to the
      theatre, and no one had any right to give them orders there. Every one was
      convinced that the Elector would soon bring the court back to Mannheim,
      and Wolfgang was only too ready to believe the assurances of his friends
      that when this took place, a fixed appointment would certainly be offered
      to him. Between Mannheim and Salzburg&mdash;what a difference! "The
      Archbishop," he wrote to his father (November 12, 1778), "cannot give me
      an equivalent for the slavery in Salzburg. I should feel nothing but
      delight were I only going to pay you a visit: but the idea of settling
      myself for good within that beggarly court is pain and grief to me." At
      Mannheim there were already prospects of immediate employment, besides&mdash;and
      what did he want more?&mdash;the opportunity for dramatic composition.
      Amid the universal desolation which was spread over Mannheim by the
      removal of the electoral court to Munich, patriotic men were not wanting
      who strove to resuscitate the intellectual and material prosperity of the
      town. Heribert von Dalberg failed indeed in his project for removing
      Heidelberg University to Mannheim, but he gained the express support of
      the Elector to the establishment of a theatre for carrying out the idea of
      an established national drama (Vol. I., p. 369).<a href="#linknote-20001"
      name="linknoteref-20001" id="linknoteref-20001"> 1 </a> Dalberg undertook
      the management with zeal and <span class="side">THE RETURN HOME.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p074.png">[74]</a></span>
      intelligence, and both the choice of pieces and the manner of
      representation were considered entirely from an artistic point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mannheim theatre first attained its peculiar importance and celebrity
      in the autumn of 1779, when the principal members of the Gotha Court
      company, with Iffland among them, were engaged at Mannheim.<a
      href="#linknote-20002" name="linknoteref-20002" id="linknoteref-20002"> 2
      </a> When Mozart was on his way back from Paris, Seyler was there with his
      company, which was only available for operetta and vaudeville. But higher
      notions were in the air; the idea of a German national opera had never
      been abandoned, and to enlist in its service such a composer as Mozart was
      a prospect not to be despised. How ready he was for the service we know.
      He had not been in Mannheim a week when he wrote, full of enthusiasm, to
      his father (November 12, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a chance of earning forty louis-d'or here! I should be obliged to
      stay six weeks or, at the longest, two months. The Seyler troupe are here;
      no doubt you know them by reputation. Herr Dalberg is manager, and refuses
      to let me go until I have composed a duodrama for him. I have made no
      objection, for I have always wished to write a drama of this kind. I do
      not remember if I told you anything about these duodramas when I was here
      before. I have been present at the performance of one of them twice with
      the greatest pleasure. In fact, I never was more surprised! for I had
      always imagined such a piece would have no effect. You know that the
      performers do not sing, but declaim, and the music is like an obbligato
      recitative. Sometimes speaking is interposed with first-rate effect. What
      I saw was "Medea," by Benda. He wrote another, "Ariadne on Naxos," both
      excellent. You know that Benda was always my favourite among the Lutheran
      kapellmeisters. I like these two works so much that I carry them about
      with me. Now you may imagine my joy at having to do just what I wished. Do
      you know what I should like? To have recitatives of this kind in opera,
      and only sometimes, when the words are readily expressible in music, to
      have them sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duodrama which he was thus burning to compose was "Semiramis," and the
      poet was his friend and patron, Herr von Gemmingen (Vol. I., p. 429). It
      was he probably who wished Mozart to remain to compose "Semiramis," for
      Dalberg <span class="side">A MONODRAMA OR AN OPERA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p075.png">[75]</a></span> had other
      views for him. He had written an opera ("Cora")<a href="#linknote-20003"
      name="linknoteref-20003" id="linknoteref-20003"> 3 </a> which he much
      wished to have composed. He had already applied to Gluck and to
      Schweitzer,<a href="#linknote-20004" name="linknoteref-20004"
      id="linknoteref-20004"> 4 </a> but not feeling sure of either of them, he
      now sought to secure Mozart. The latter wrote to him (Mannheim, November
      24, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur le Baron,&mdash;I have already waited upon you twice without
      having had the honour of finding you at liberty; yesterday I believe you
      were at home, but I was not able to speak with you. I must therefore ask
      you to pardon me for troubling you with a few lines, for it is very
      important to me that I should explain myself fully to you. Monsieur le
      Baron, you know that I am not mercenary, especially when I am in a
      position to be of service to so great a lover and so true a connoisseur of
      music as yourself. On the other hand, I feel certain that you would not
      desire that I should be in any way injured by the transaction; I am
      therefore bold enough to make my final proposition on the matter, since I
      cannot possibly remain longer in uncertainty. I undertake, for twenty-five
      louis-d'or, to write a monodrama, to remain here two months longer, to
      arrange everything, attend the rehearsals, &amp;c.; but with this proviso,
      that, let what will happen, I shall be paid by the end of January. That I
      shall be free of the theatre is a matter of course.<a
      href="#linknote-20005" name="linknoteref-20005" id="linknoteref-20005"> 5
      </a> This, Monsieur le Baron, is the utmost I can offer; if you consider
      it, I think you will see that I am acting very moderately. As far as your
      opera is concerned, I assure you that I should like above all things to
      set it to music. That I could not undertake such a work as that for
      twenty-five louis-d'or, you will readily allow; for it would contain at
      the most moderate computation quite as much work again as a monodrama; the
      only thing that would make me hesitate to undertake it is that, as you
      tell me, Gluck and Schweitzer are already writing it. But even supposing
      that you offered me fifty louis-d'or for it, I would as an honest man
      dissuade you from it. What is to become of an opera without singers,
      either male or female? At the same time, if there were any prospect of its
      being well produced I would not refuse to undertake the work from regard
      for you; and it would be no trifle, I give you my word of honour. Now I
      have told you my ideas clearly and straightforwardly, and I must beg for a
      speedy decision. If I could have an answer to-day I should be all the
      better pleased, for I have heard that some one is going to travel alone to
      Munich next Thursday, and I would gladly profit by the opportunity.

      Mozart would hardly have left Mannheim as long as a glimmer of hope
      remained&mdash;he, who was so overjoyed at finding employment there that
      he wrote to his father (November 12, 1778): "They are arranging an
      AcadÃ©mie des Amateurs here, like the one in Paris. Herr Franzl is to lead
      the violins, and I am writing them a concerto for clavier and violin."<a
      href="#linknote-20006" name="linknoteref-20006" id="linknoteref-20006"> 6
      </a> But his father, who was very dissatisfied with the "foolish fancy"
      for remaining in Mannheim, came to the point, and represented to him
      (November 19, 1778) how impossible it would be for the Elector to return
      to Mannheim. It was especially undesirable now to seek a post in the
      Bavarian service, since the death of Karl Theodor had "let loose on the
      world a whole army of artists, who are in Mannheim and Munich seeking a
      mode of livelihood. The Duke of ZweibrÃ¼cken himself had an orchestra of
      thirty-six performers, and the former Mannheim establishment cost 80,000
      florins." He cares nothing for the "possible earning of 40 louis-d'or,"
      but emphatically orders: "Set off as soon as you receive this!" And to
      meet any conceivable remonstrance, he once more sets plainly forth the
      true position of affairs (November 23, 1778):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two things of which your head is full and which obscure your
      true judgment. The first and principal is your love for Mdlle. Weber, to
      which I am not altogether opposed. I was not formerly, when her father was
      poor, and why should I be so now when she may make your fortune instead of
      you hers? I conjecture that her father is aware of your love, since all
      Mannheim knows it, since Herr Fiala (oboist in Salzburg) has heard it,
      since Herr Bullinger, who teaches at Count Lodron's, told me of it. He
      travelled with some Mannheim musicians from Ellwang (where he was in the
      vacation), and they could talk of nothing but your cleverness,
      compositions, and love for Mdlle. Weber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Salzburg, the father goes on, he would be so near Munich that he could
      easily go there, or Mdlle. Weber could come to Salzburg, where she might
      stay with them. Opportunities would not be wanting. Fiala had told the
      Archbishop a great deal about Mdlle. Weber's singing and <span class="side">MOZART
      LEAVES MANNHEIM, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p077.png">[77]</a></span> Wolfgang's good prospects in
      Mannheim. He might also invite his other friends&mdash;Cannabich,
      Wendling, Ritter, Ramm. They would all find hospitable welcome in his
      father's house
    </p>
    <p>
      Most especially will your acceptance of the present office (which is the
      second subject of which your head is full) be your only certain
      opportunity for revisiting Italy, which is what I have more at heart than
      anything else. And your acceptance is indispensably necessary, unless you
      have the abominable and unfilial desire to bring scorn and derision on
      your anxious father&mdash;on that father who has sacrificed every hour of
      his life to his children to bring them credit and honour. I am not in a
      position to pay my debts, which now amount in all to one thousand florins,
      unless you lighten the payment by the receipt of your salary. I can then
      certainly pay off four hundred florins a year, and live comfortably with
      you two. I should like, if it is the will of God, to live a few years
      more, and to pay my debts, and then you may, if you choose, run your head
      against the wall at once. But no! your heart is good. You are not wicked,
      only thoughtless&mdash;it will all come!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not to be withstood. Wolfgang wrote that he would set off on
      December 9, but he still declined to travel the shortest way (December 3,
      1778): "I must tell you what a good opportunity I have for a travelling
      companion next Wednesday&mdash;no other than the Bishop of Kaysersheim.
      One of my friends mentioned me to him; he remembered my name, and
      expressed great pleasure at the idea of travelling with me; he is a
      thoroughly kind, good man, although he is a priest and a prelate. So that
      I shall go viÃ¤ Kaysersheim, instead of Stuttgart."
    </p>
    <p>
      The farewell to Mannheim was a sad one, both to Mozart and his friends.
      Madame Cannabich, who had earned the right to be considered as his best
      and truest friend, and who placed implicit confidence in him, was
      specially sorrowful; she refused to rise for his early departure, feeling
      unequal to the leave-taking, and he crept silently away that he might not
      add to her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was loth to give up his monodrama: "I am now writing," he says
      (December 3, 1778), "to please Herr von Gemmingen and myself, the first
      act of the declamatory opera which I was to have finished here; as it is,
      I shall <span class="side">THE RETURN HOME.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p078.png">[78]</a></span> take it with me, and go on with
      it at home; my eagerness for this kind of composition is uncontrollable."<a
      href="#linknote-20007" name="linknoteref-20007" id="linknoteref-20007"> 7
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop took such an "extraordinary liking" for him that he was
      persuaded to stay at Kaysersheim, and to make an expedition with his host
      to Munich, where he arrived on December 25. Here he looked forward to some
      pleasant days in the society of all his Mannheim friends, and above all to
      reunion with his beloved Aloysia. In order that nothing might be wanting
      to his pleasure he begged his cousin to come to Munich, and hinted that
      she might have an important part to play there: he had no doubt of the
      success of his suit. But he almost immediately after received a letter
      from his father, ordering him in the most positive manner to set out by
      the first diligence in January, and not on any account to be persuaded by
      Cannabich to make a further postponement. L. Mozart foresaw that Wolfgang
      would make another effort to escape the slavery in Salzburg, and that his
      friends would encourage him to hope for a place under the Court at Munich.
      In anticipation of this he once more laid plainly before him that the
      settlement in Salzburg would afford the only possibility of putting their
      affairs in order. This representation arrived very inopportunely for
      Wolfgang. Cannabich and Raaff were, in point of fact, working "hand and
      foot" for him. By their advice he had already undertaken to write a mass
      for the Elector, and the sonatas (Vol. I., p. 415; II., p. 70) which he
      had dedicated to the Electress had arrived just in time to be presented by
      him in person; and in the midst of <span class="side">MUNICH, 1778&mdash;BECKE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p079.png">[79]</a></span> all this
      his father's letter dashed his hopes to the ground, and added to his
      gloomy anticipations of life in Salzburg the fear that he would not be
      kindly received. He opened his heart to their old friend the flautist
      Becke (Vol. I., p. 228), who moved him still further by his account of the
      kindness and indulgence of his father. "I have never written so badly
      before," he writes to his father (December 29, 1778); "I cannot do it; my
      heart is too much inclined for weeping. I hope you will soon write and
      console me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Becke also wrote on behalf of Wolfgang:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He burns with desire to embrace his dearest and best-beloved father, as
      soon as his present circumstances will allow of it; he almost makes me
      lose my composure, for I was an hour or more in quieting his tears. He has
      the best heart in the world! I have never seen a child with a more loving
      and tender affection for his father than your son. He has a little
      misgiving lest your reception of him should not be as tender as he could
      wish; but I hope quite otherwise from your fatherly heart. His heart is so
      pure, so childlike, so open to me; how much more so will it not be to his
      father! No one can hear him speak without doing him justice as the
      best-intentioned, most earnest, and most honourable of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart answered at once that his son might rely on the most loving
      welcome, and that everything would be done to entertain him; the autumn
      festivities and quoit prize-meetings had been postponed on his account.
      But he bids him observe that his long delay, the appointment being already
      four months old, is beginning to make the Archbishop impatient, and it
      must not go so far as to cause him to draw back in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Wolfgang answered (January 8,1779):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you, my dear father, that I feel only pleasure in coming to you
      (not to Salzburg) now that I see by your last letter that you have learnt
      to know me better. There has been no other cause for this last
      postponement of my journey home than the doubt I felt (which, when I could
      no longer contain myself, I confided to my friend Becke) as to my
      reception. What other cause could there be? I know that I am not guilty of
      anything that should make me feel your reproaches. I have committed no
      fault (for I call that only a fault which is not becoming to an honourable
      man and a Christian). I look forward with delight to many pleasant and
      happy days, but only in the society of you and my dear sister. I give you
      my honour that I cannot endure Salzburg and its inhabitants (that is,
      natives of Salzburg). Their speech and their way of living are thoroughly
      distasteful to me.

      Mozart had other causes than this for despondency; before he left Munich
      he was destined to be painfully undeceived. He had been kindly welcomed by
      the Webers, who insisted on his staying with them; Aloysia had made
      striking progress as a vocalist, and Mozart, as might well be expected
      from him, rendered anew his musical homage to her by writing for her (li 8
      di Gennaio, 1779) a grand aria (316 K.). He had designedly chosen as a
      subject the recitative and air with which Alceste first enters in Gluck's
      Italian opera; Schweitzer's "Alceste" had been performed in Munich, so
      that Mozart entered the lists with both composers. In order to provide his
      friends, Ramm and Ritter, with a piece of brilliant execution, he made the
      oboe and bassoon accompany obbligato, and emulate the voice part. The song
      is admirably adapted for a bravura piece, affording to the singer an
      opportunity for the display of varied powers and great compass, together
      with artistic cultivation of the voice. The recitative may be considered
      as an attempt at dramatic delivery of a grand and dignified kind; the song
      itself affords in both its parts, Andante sostenuto e cantabile, and
      Allegro assai, the most charming instances of sustained singing and
      brilliant execution. It is written for a high soprano, seldom going so low
      as [See Page Image] generally upwards from What is expected of the singer
      in the way of compass and volubility may be judged by passages such as&mdash;[See
      Page Image] <span class="side">AIR FOR ALOYSIA WEBER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p081.png">[81]</a></span> in the
      Allegro. But the importance of this song does not depend alone on the
      brilliancy of its passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recitative, undeniably the most important section of the composition,
      is second to none of Mozart's later recitatives in depth and truth of
      expression and noble beauty, and is richly provided with unexpected
      harmonic changes, such as he used more sparingly in later songs. The very
      first entry of the voice is striking and beautiful, with a long and
      pathetic prelude:&mdash;[See Page Image] <span class="side">THE RETURN
      HOME.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p082.png">[82]</a></span>
      and the close of the recitative is equally effective:&mdash;[See Page
      Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      If this carefully and minutely elaborated recitative be compared with
      Gluck's simple secco recitative there can be no doubt that Mozart's is far
      superior, both in fertility of invention and marked characterisation. But
      it must not be left out of account that if Mozart, treating the recitative
      and air as one independent whole, was right to emphasise and <span
      class="side">SONG FOR ALOYSIA WEBER, 1778.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p083.png">[83]</a></span> elaborate details, Gluck had to
      consider the situation in its connection with a greater whole; in which
      respect his simple but expressive recitative is quite in its right place.
      The song itself in depth of tragic pathos is not altogether on a level
      with the recitative. It consists of two movements, an Andantino and an
      Allegro, very nearly equal in length and compass, and each of them
      independently arranged and elaborated. The motifs in both are simple and
      expressive (especially the passionate middle part of the Allegro in C
      minor), but in performance the attention to bravura, necessitated by the
      emulation of the wind instruments, detracts from the intensity and
      earnestness of tone. The treatment is masterly, both of the voice and the
      two instruments, whether considered singly or in relation to each other;
      it is equally so of the orchestra (quartet and horns), which forms a
      foundation for the free movement of the solo parts. In the hands of a
      first-rate performer the song could not fail to have a brilliant and
      striking effect. But the exclusive reference to individual talents and
      executive powers detracted of necessity from the dramatic effect, and if
      the composer had given full sway to his passions the harmony he calculated
      on between his work and the performer would have been lost. As far as we
      can judge of Aloysia Weber as a singer from the songs composed for her by
      Mozart, the powerful rendering of violent and fiery passion was not her
      forte. Her delivery cannot be said to have been wanting in depth of
      feeling, and yet a certain moderation seems to have been peculiar to her,
      which Mozart turned to account as an element of artistic harmony.<a
      href="#linknote-20008" name="linknoteref-20008" id="linknoteref-20008"> 8
      </a> This song was a parting salutation to Aloysia Weber. A touching
      memorial of the parting is preserved in the voice part of a song ("Ah se
      in ciel") written by Mozart's hand in 1788 (538 K.). At the close of it
      she has written the words: "Nei giomi tuoi felici pensa qualche volta al
      Popoli di Tessaglia."
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart, with his custom of reckoning on the <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p084.png">[84]</a></span> selfishness of mankind, had
      already expressed apprehension lest Weber, now that he no longer required
      Wolfgang's good offices, should cease to desire his friendship. This was
      not indeed the case, but he found a great change in Aloysia's sentiments.
      "She appeared no longer to recognise him for whom she had once wept. So
      Mozart sat down to the clavier and sang loud: 'Ich lass das MÃ¤del gern,
      das mich nicht will.'"<a href="#linknote-20009" name="linknoteref-20009"
      id="linknoteref-20009"> 9 </a> This renunciation might satisfy his pride,
      but not his heart; his love was too true and deep to evaporate as lightly
      as the whim of a woman whose true character he learnt to know later. And
      yet he wrote from Vienna to his father (May 16, 1781): "I was a fool about
      Lange's wife, that is certain; but who is not when he is in love? I loved
      her in very deed, and I feel that she is not yet indifferent to me. A good
      thing for me that her husband is a jealous fool and never lets her out of
      his sight, so that I seldom see her!" On January 7, 1779, Mozart was
      presented to the Electress by Cannabich, and handed her the sonatas he had
      composed for her; she conversed with him very graciously for a good
      half-hour. A few days after, he saw Schweitzer's "Alceste," which was the
      Carnival opera, and at last, after repeated injunctions from his father,
      he set out for Salzburg in the comfortable carriage of his
      fellow-traveller, a Salzburg merchant named Gschwendner.

      CHAPTER XXI. COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MOZART was welcomed to the paternal roof<span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p084.png">[84]</a></span> with open arms; everything was
      prepared for his reception; "a convenient cupboard and the clavichord were
      placed in his room," the cook Theresa had cooked capons without number,
      the high steward Count von Firmian (Vol. I., p. 345) offered him his
      horses, and Dr. Prexl also placed his "beautiful <span class="side">MOZART'S
      DISTASTE TO SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p085.png">[85]</a></span> bay mare" at his disposal; in
      short, Mozart's return home was a happy and triumphant event to all the
      good friends of his youth. We know the feelings with which he returned.
      Disappointed in his hopes of rapid and brilliant success, he returned to
      the old condition of things, and the yoke must have pressed on him all the
      more heavily now that his illusions were dispelled and he no longer saw a
      prospect of shaking it off. He had buried his mother in a foreign land,
      and his warm true heart had been deceived in its first love; in poverty he
      returned to his father's house. He was not in a position to see as clearly
      as we do how powerfully his added experience of life and manifold artistic
      impressions had contributed to his moral and mental development, and he
      could scarcely be expected to look to this development for the strength
      and courage necessary to face the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commencement of his residence in Salzburg was cheered by the presence
      of his lively young cousin; she had followed him from Munich on his
      entreaties, to pay a visit of some weeks to her uncle. Mozart's amiability
      and cordial manners renewed many pleasant intimacies, but the actual cause
      of his distaste to Salzburg, viz., the want of cultivation and of a
      disinterested love of art among its inhabitants, remained as before, and
      his long absence was likely to make him feel it all the more sensibly. The
      Archbishop, compelled by circumstances and his surroundings to recall
      Mozart, had not by any means forgiven his voluntary resignation of his
      former office, and the disinclination to return which Mozart had so
      evidently displayed, was certainly not calculated to appease his ill-will.
      We shall soon learn the kind of treatment which Mozart had to expect from
      him. The Salzburg public are described by Wolfgang in a letter to his
      father (May 26, 1781): "When I play in Salzburg, or when any of my
      compositions are performed, the audience might just as well be chairs or
      tables." He declares that, although he actually loves work far better than
      idleness, the want of congenial intercourse and inspiring surroundings
      make it often almost impossible for him to set to work at composition.
      "And why? Because my mind is not at ease." Again, he says (April 8, 1781):
      "To dawdle away one's <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p086.png">[86]</a></span> youth in
      such a wretched hole is sad enough, and harmful besides." This and similar
      expressions might lead one to suppose that Mozart had neglected
      composition during these years, but a survey of the works which are known
      to us suffices to dispel this idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      His musical activity took as a matter of course, in all essential points,
      the same direction as formerly; his official position as concertmeister
      and as court and cathedral organist (for so he was entered in the Salzburg
      Court Calendar), gave occasion for instrumental and church compositions,
      the style and materials of which were as restricted as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first instrumental composition, in G major (318 K.), dated April 26,
      1779, seems to have been written for some very special occasion. The
      orchestra is strongly appointed (besides the quartet there are two flutes,
      two oboes, two bassoons, four horns in G and D, and two trumpets in C, and
      used for effects which must have startled the Salzburgers. It is in the
      form now usual for overtures, but out of date for concert symphonies,
      viz.: three connected movements, Allegro spiritoso 4-4, which contains,
      besides the principal energetic motif with which it begins, and which
      constantly recurs in different ways, two independent, quieter motifs in
      succession: Andante 3-8, gentle and soft, somewhat longer than is usual
      for middle movements, but simple and without thematic elaboration; it
      leads back to the first Allegro, shortened (by the omission of the second
      subordinate subject) and modified in the elaboration. The individual and
      dramatic character of this composition, expressed most particularly in the
      commencement and the close of it, makes it probable that it was written as
      an introduction to a drama. We shall see that there was no lack of
      occasion for such works. Also belonging to this period are two symphonies
      in the usual three movements.<a href="#linknote-21001"
      name="linknoteref-21001" id="linknoteref-21001"> 1 </a> The earlier, in B
      major (319 K., <span class="side">SYMPHONIES&mdash;SERENADE, 1779.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p087.png">[87]</a></span> part
      II), composed in the summer (July 9) of 1779, was evidently the results of
      "a pleased frame of mind"; it is a genuine product of Mozart's humour,
      lively, cheerful and full of grace and feeling. The second, a year later
      (August 29, 1780), in C major (338 K., part 10), is grander in conception
      and more serious in tone. This is particularly noticeable in the first
      movement; a constant propensity to fall into the minor key blends strength
      and decision with an expression not so much of melancholy as of
      consolation. In perfect harmony of conception, the simple and fervent
      Andante di molto combines exceeding tenderness with a quiet depth of tone.
      The contrasting instrumentation is very effective in this work; the first
      movement is powerful and brilliant, but in the second only stringed
      instruments (with doubled tenors) are employed. The last movement is
      animated throughout, and sometimes the orchestral treatment is rapid and
      impetuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Serenade in D major (320 K.) belongs also to 1779, composed probably for
      some special festival, and (except that the march is omitted) quite in the
      style of the early already-noticed serenades<a href="#linknote-21002"
      name="linknoteref-21002" id="linknoteref-21002"> 2 </a> (Vol. I., p. 301).
      A short Adagio serves as introduction to a brilliant Allegro, arranged
      exactly like the first movement of a symphony, and worked out at
      considerable length; to this follows a minuet. Then there is inserted a
      concertante, described as such in the title, consisting of two movements,
      an Andante grazioso 3-4, and a rondo, Allegro ma non troppo 2-4, both in G
      major.<a href="#linknote-21003" name="linknoteref-21003"
      id="linknoteref-21003"> 3 </a> In earlier days, when Mozart figured as a
      violin-player, a violin solo played the chief part in such compositions;
      but now the wind instruments, two flutes, two oboes, and two bassoons are
      employed concertante; the stringed instruments and horns form the
      accompaniment proper. These two pieces are elaborated with great care and
      accuracy, and are clear and perspicuous as well as tender and graceful;
      <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p088.png">[88]</a></span> the rondo is somewhat lighter in
      tone than the first movement. Of bravura, properly so called, there is
      none to be found, and the ornamental passages are confined to moderate
      amplifications of the melodies. The instruments are solo in that they bear
      the principal part throughout, concertante in that they emulate each other
      in manifold and changing combinations; their strife is playful, with
      sometimes almost a mischievous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Andantino which follows offers a strong contrast to both movements of
      the concertante. This is marked at once by the fact that the stringed
      instruments are here put forward as the exponents of the musical idea,
      while the very sparely used wind instruments only emphasise certain sharp
      points of detail. But the contrast is deeper than this; the light and
      sunshiny mood of the two previous movements accentuates the serious
      melancholy of the Andantino, which seems to tell not of the pain of an
      existing passion, but of the inner peace of a sorrow overcome. After a
      less noticeable minuet<a href="#linknote-21004" name="linknoteref-21004"
      id="linknoteref-21004"> 4 </a> the serenade closes with a long elaborate
      Presto, an important movement full of life and force; the most emphatic
      contrapuntal arrangement of the principal theme is in the middle passage;
      it is lively and original, as well as technically correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melodies and subjects of these works show unmistakable progress; they
      are of maturer invention, have more musical substance, if the expression
      may be allowed, more delicacy and nobility of apprehension. Technical
      progress is visible in the greater freedom of the contrapuntal treatment,
      which had already been fully developed in Mozart's vocal compositions.
      This is most obviously apparent in those parts where thematic elaboration
      predominates, which are richer and freer than hitherto. There are also
      many motifs which owe their importance mainly to their contrapuntal
      treatment. But, above all, we recognise Mozart's sure tact in preserving
      the limits that prevent the interest in the <span class="side">PROGRESS IN
      INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p089.png">[89]</a></span> different combinations of
      counterpoint to which a motive can be subjected from becoming essentially
      technical, and losing its artistic character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally surely has his genius preserved him from the mistake of ascribing
      any absolute value to the contrapuntal method, or favouring the logical
      element which lies in it to the disadvantage of sensuous beauty. He makes
      use of the forms of counterpoint only to arrest the attention and to
      heighten the interest, without wearying the mind, intruding a foreign
      element into the original essence of the work, or neglecting beauty of
      form; Mozart never forgets that music must be melodious. Therefore a
      receptive although uncultivated hearer receives a pleasing impression from
      artistic and even intricate passages, without at all suspecting the
      difficulties which he enjoys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the influence of the contrapuntal method reaches far deeper than
      well-defined and scholastic forms, just as a well-considered discourse
      does not consist merely in the observance of syllogistic forms. The
      principle of the free movement of the separate members of one whole
      penetrates the minutest divisions;
    </p>
    <p>
      and the combined effects of creative ability and artistic cultivation are
      nowhere so well displayed as in the independent construction of the
      separate elements which go to form the whole work. We admire Mozart's art
      in devising his plan, in accurately distributing his principal parts, and
      in disposing his lights and shades; but where he is in truth inexhaustible
      is in his power of strewing round a wealth of small touches which assist
      the characterisation and give to each part its peculiar effect and, in
      some respect, the justification of its existence. This power, which always
      seems to have something at command beyond the necessities of the case
      (although, in fact, every detail which seems to be the chance expression
      of individual vigour is conditioned of necessity by the whole conception),
      is the prerogative of genuine creative genius. It approaches the eternal
      power of nature, whose apparent prodigality is revealed to the deeper view
      as the wisest economy, or rather as the unruffled harmony of a great
      whole. So a statue by Phidias suggests to the spectator the impression of
      animated <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p090.png">[90]</a></span> nature,
      because it not merely puts before his eyes in general features a
      representation of the bodily form of man, but suggests to him the totality
      of the muscular movements which are in a living body in incessant
      activity. It is in art as in nature: the further we penetrate the fewer
      and less complex become the governing forces and impulses. Many details
      may be considered as trifling until it is asked whether they, in their
      place, have the required effect as part of the whole. When a work of art
      gives an effect of an artistic whole, in a way which cannot be explained
      by a consideration of its apparently insignificant parts, this may be
      taken as the surest proof that the artist worked downwards from his
      conception of a great whole to the minutest details of his work. We must
      not undervalue, on the other hand, Mozart's more exact knowledge and freer
      use than formerly of external means. His residence in Mannheim had given
      him an altogether new conception of the performance of a good orchestra,
      both as to sound-effects and execution. The result is present in these
      compositions, although Salzburg surroundings and customs limited him
      greatly in his choice of means. It may be that for these reasons his
      instrumental combinations show no marked progress on former works, but the
      skilful use of the forces at his command become all the more apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable how, without any alteration in the instrumentation as a
      whole, the body of sound has become richer and fuller, the result of a
      more careful consideration of the particular nature of each instrument.
      This is most striking in the management of the wind instruments. The
      bassoons predominate throughout, independently treated, whereas formerly
      they only strengthened the bass; and the use of the horns, with their
      long-sustained notes, shows marked progress. The combination of the wind
      instruments, sometimes in opposition to the stringed instruments,
      sometimes in unison with them, is another advance. Effective as are the
      wind instruments in combination, they are still more so in the delicacy of
      their individual features, and the perfection of their treatment could not
      fail to influence that of the stringed instruments, which show the same
      higher conception of what orchestral performances ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AS A CONDUCTOR.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p091.png">[91]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mannheim experiences were not without result either in respect to the
      executive delivery of the orchestra. Mozart must have been particularly
      impressed with the effect of <i>crescendo</i>, for almost in every passage
      we meet with phrases built upon a long-drawn <i>crescendo</i>. The
      contrast between <i>piano</i> and <i>forte</i> is also made the most of.
      Regular alternations of long passages <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i> were
      formerly the custom, but now we have a rapid succession of very varied
      shades, <i>fortissimo</i> and <i>pianissimo</i> being also brought into
      use. But all these are only the outward signs of a higher intellectual
      apprehension, for which it was necessary also to give credit to the
      performers; the composer, far from relying only on external effect, makes
      it the mere expression of the deeper meaning and intrinsic value of his
      compositions; it is from this point of view that the progress made by
      Mozart in the manipulation of his artistic materials acquires its true
      worth in the eyes of a musical critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may imagine that Mozart found it no easy task to substitute a
      completely new style of execution for the time-honoured customs of the
      Salzburg band. The energy with which he was able at a later date to
      inspire the Leipzig orchestra, wedded as it was to its own traditions,
      gives some indication of his way of proceeding as a young man at Salzburg.
      His cousin used to hold forth later on Mozart's eccentric behaviour when
      conducting, and we may imagine that she witnessed some of the
      extraordinary scenes she describes during her present visit to Salzburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart never appeared again as a violin-player, and we therefore find no
      compositions for the violin belonging to this period. After such an
      expression of opinion concerning the Salzburg public as that noted above,
      we cannot wonder that he was not over-anxious to appear before them as a
      clavier-player. We doubtless owe the Concerto for two claviers with
      orchestral accompaniment in E flat major (365 K., part 17) to his wish to
      play a duet with his sister.<a href="#linknote-21005"

    </p>
    <p>
      In design and treatment it is essentially similar to the earlier triple
      concerto. There is no intention apparent of making the two instruments
      independent; the players emulate each other in the delivery of the
      melodies and passages, sometimes together, sometimes in succession, often
      breaking off in rapid changes and interruptions; the melodies are
      sometimes simply repeated, sometimes with variations so divided between
      the two instruments that neither can be said to have the advantage over
      the other. There are somewhat greater difficulties of execution than have
      been usual hitherto, a few passages, for instance, in octaves and thirds,
      but very modest ones; the passages generally have more variety and
      elegance. The orchestra is simply and judiciously, but very delicately
      treated, the wind instruments in sustained chords, as a foundation for the
      clavier passages; the effect of the <i>crescendo</i> and a greater
      attention to light and shade show the influence of Mannheim. Altogether
      the concerto is a well-arranged composition, clear and melodious, as well
      as accurately constructed, with a free, cheerful expression, which is most
      strikingly shown in the fresh gaiety of the last movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As organist, Mozart was under the necessity of playing the organ at
      festivals, but as a rule only for accompaniments and for interludes at set
      places, which gave him opportunities for improvising&mdash;his special
      delight. We have some organ sonatas with orchestral accompaniments
      belonging to this time (328, 329, 336, K.), quite in the style of those
      already noticed (Vol. I., p. 286); compositions after the fashion of the
      first movement of a sonata, without a trace of ecclesiastical severity,
      either in the technical construction, which is very light, or in the
      style, which is brilliant and cheerful. The organ occurs as an obbligato
      instrument only in one of these sonatas (329 K.), which is the most
      elaborated, but still very moderate in style, and without any florid
      passages.

      Of more important church compositions there belong to this period two
      Masses in C major, of which the earlier (317 K.) is one of Mozart's
      best-known works of the kind, bearing date March 23, 1779, and the later
      (337 K.) was written in March, 1780.<a href="#linknote-21006"
      name="linknoteref-21006" id="linknoteref-21006"> 6 </a> They are quite
      after the prescribed manner, not too long, not too serious, and yet not
      light; in no respect difficult or important, and closely allied in
      substance and treatment to the earlier works which have already been
      analysed (Vol. I., pp. 263 et seq.). The easy invention, never at a loss
      for fitting expression, the talent for organisation which arranges the
      parts into a connected and coherent whole, the technical sureness which
      gives to every detail its due share of interest&mdash;above all, the
      inexhaustible gift of melody and symmetry: all these qualities are here to
      be found, and it is by their aid that, in spite of hampering
      circumstances, such great and healthy work was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, these Masses show more plainly even than earlier works of
      the same kind how the fetters of outward control check the impulses of
      inner strength and feeling. We see Mozart as it were in court dress; he is
      expert enough to move in it with tolerable freedom, but he is disguised
      rather than clothed. Conventional influence is most apparent in the
      instrumentation, which, as a whole, is little different from that of the
      earlier works. Some passages are remarkable even in their instrumentation;
      for instance, the Et incarnatus and Crucifixus of the first Mass have an
      expressive violin passage, and in the second the treatment of the wind
      instruments in the Crucifixus and Resurrexit, and the organ, oboe, and
      bassoon in emulation with the voice in the Agnus Dei, remind us of
      Mannheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these are details, and in its general features the tone-colouring of
      the orchestra is the same as formerly; rapid violin passages predominate,
      the trombone follows the voice regularly and <i>forte</i>, and so on. But
      in other respects original features are not wanting, nor even passages of
      surprising beauty, to which belongs, for instance, the unusually melodious
      close of the first Mass, in which the Benedictus, <span class="side">COURT
      SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p094.png">[94]</a></span> contrary to custom in a serious
      choral movement, is in strict counterpoint. These are signs of a great
      genius, which make us regret all the more that the whole work is not
      dictated and inspired by the same spirit. To this period also, according
      to the handwriting, belongs a Kyrie sketched by Mozart and not preserved
      quite complete (323 K.), which has been completed and printed as a Regina
      coeli by Stadler. It is characterised by a rapid sextole passage which is
      distributed among the wind instruments in uninterrupted movement. The
      voices take their own independent course throughout. Among other
      unfinished attempts by Mozart preserved in the Mozarteum at Salzburg, and
      both by the handwriting and instrumentation, as well as from other
      reasons, to be referred to this time, we may particularise the beginning
      of a Mass with obbligato organ (Anh., 13 K.) and the beginning (two pages)
      of a Kyrie (Anh., 16 K.), which is in such strict counterpoint that the
      Mass, if it had been finished, would have been among the most elaborate of
      them all. But Mozart had neither inducement nor the means for producing
      such compositions in Salzburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two Vespers by Mozart (321, 339, K.), of the years 1779 and 1780, have
      much the same resemblance in substance and compass to masses that litanies
      had at an earlier period, but they stand higher in many respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five psalms and the Virgin's hymn of praise form the part of the Vespers
      which is in varied chant; every division ends with the doxology, and is
      complete in itself. In the Litany the principal part is framed in, as it
      were, by two equally original and characteristic movements, the Kyrie and
      Agnus; the Vespers, on the other hand consist of six separate movements
      which have no connection, either actual or artistic. More striking
      differences of key are therefore permissible than is generally the case
      with the movements of one composition,<a href="#linknote-21007"
      name="linknoteref-21007" id="linknoteref-21007"> 7 </a> and it was
      possible to put together at pleasure <span class="side">VESPERS, 1779,
      1780.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p095.png">[95]</a></span>
      psalms belonging to different compositions, sometimes even by different
      composers. The Dixit and Magnificat, as the two corner-posts, were
      considered the principal parts; they were generally specially composed,
      and: others inserted between them. As the words of the doxology (Gloria
      Patri) recur at the close of each movement, it would have been natural
      that the idea should arise of giving them the same musical rendering, and
      suggesting a relation between the different movements by this kind of
      refrain. But they are, on the contrary, in close connection with the words
      to which they serve as a conclusion, so as to characterise the use of the
      general formula as dependent on the special nature of each case. For the
      most part, therefore, a principal subject of the piece which it concludes
      is utilised for the doxology, and it is astonishing of what a variety of
      appropriate and expressive musical renderings these words are capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A settled custom became established, both as to the general conception and
      the distinguishing characteristics of these compositions, which was
      closely followed even by Mozart. In the main, the conception and treatment
      resembled those of the litanies; the effort is evident to reconcile the
      requirements of Divine service with the prevailing and somewhat trivial
      musical taste of the times. But the vespers preserved the dignity and
      solemnity of church music more strictly than the litanies. There is no
      sign of a leaning to operatic style, concessions to bravura are sparely
      and exceptionally made, the orchestra preserves the simplicity of the
      traditional church orchestra,<a href="#linknote-21008"
      name="linknoteref-21008" id="linknoteref-21008"> 8 </a> and limited scope
      is allowed even to grace and pleasing fancies. Nevertheless, the
      expression of dignity and solemnity shows the influence of a time which
      did not exact from sacred art the absorption of the inner man in the
      sacred and the divine, but was satisfied with a decent <span class="side">COURT
      SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p096.png">[96]</a></span> observance of the forms of
      external homage. It was left to the artist, who had a deeper spiritual
      craving, and such a delicate artistic sense as forbade the use of form
      without substance, to give a higher tone to his work. In this sense we may
      include by far the larger portions of these vespers among Mozart's great
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      As concerns the musical construction in detail, a narrow mode of treatment
      resulted throughout from the conditions of worship; the words had to be
      composed straight through, just as in short Masses. A broader rendering of
      separate portions which might seem to lend themselves to musical
      expression was not admitted, and the endeavour after a dramatic
      characterisation of certain points did not come within the artistic usages
      of the time. The important point, therefore, was not to render the words
      in music, so as to give a new and fitting expression to each detail, but
      to invent characteristic motifs for the important points which should be
      suitable for further elaboration, and which, in spite of individual
      distinction, should spring from the fundamental conception of the whole
      work. The task of the composer is not made easier by the words of the
      psalms; they do not offer a good basis for musical construction, nor are
      the ideas conveyed in them generally such as would incite to musical
      production. The composer must therefore be original in no ordinary degree,
      and it is excusable if he now and then handles the rules and forms of his
      art with a certain amount of abruptness, and even makes verbal expression
      subservient to them, so far as it can be done without harmful pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to introduce variety among these closely allied compositions a
      certain type had been formed, which was not exactly the inevitable
      consequence of the effort to satisfy the rules of art and of good taste,
      but, as in the litanies, exercised considerable influence over the
      treatment of the text. The two vespers we are considering are very similar
      in form and workmanship. Various parts are treated in both with marked
      preference, and it is scarcely possible to place one before the other in
      merit, except that perhaps the earlier one is the more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first psalm, Dixit Dominus, is formed into an <span class="side">VESPERS,
      1779, 1780.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p097.png">[97]</a></span>
      animated, restless movement, full of strength and dignity; while the same
      tone predominates in both, there is more fire and brilliancy in the first
      composition, more mildness and tranquillity in the second. The kind of
      treatment may be compared to that of the Gloria and Credo of the Mass.
      Without any sustained thematic elaboration, certain principal motifs are
      maintained and emphasised in different ways. The animated string passages
      are not only in varied harmonic combinations, but often in counterpoint,
      either imitative or a combination of the different subjects. The voices
      are free and independent, but with a few trifling exceptions they are
      treated harmonically; solo voices sometimes alternate with the chorus, but
      without any special prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second psalm, Confitebor tibi, Domine, is in the earlier Vesper (321
      K.), a chorale with solo intermixed, accompanied only by the organ and
      stringed instruments (E minor 3-4). This mature and beautiful composition
      approaches the Mass in F major (Vol. I., p. 257) both in tender and
      fervent sentiment and in simplicity and purity of form. But there the
      treatment is contrapuntal throughout, here it is essentially harmonic. The
      independent progress of the voices displays a succession of rich and
      startling harmonies in animated but natural development; notwithstanding
      many suspensions and unexpected turns, they are always clear and
      melodious, and always the true and natural expression of the sentiment to
      be conveyed.<a href="#linknote-21009" name="linknoteref-21009"
      id="linknoteref-21009"> 9 </a> The frame of mind represented is not one of
      fanatical remorse, but rather of a soul penetrated with the feeling of
      guilt, and impelled to acknowledge it with shame and anguish. The moderate
      expression of such a mood, which might easily pass over into the
      sentimental, coincides with the symmetry of form observable in the main
      features as well as in the details of the work. The corresponding movement
      of the second Vesper (339 K.) is not to be placed on the same level as
      this. It maintains on the whole the tone of the first movement, with an
      increase of earnestness, <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p098.png">[98]</a></span> and is a
      clever and melodious composition, with good effect in its place; but the
      poetical beauty of the other is altogether wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third psalm, Beatus vir, has least original colouring. It is in both
      Vespers a lively, powerful, one might almost say, cheerful movement,
      suggestive of the Gloria or Credo of more than one mass, but without the
      solemnity which characterises them. Here, too, solo voices alternate with
      the chorus<a href="#linknote-210010" name="linknoteref-210010"
      id="linknoteref-210010"> 10 </a> without interrupting the steady flow of
      the composition. In the earlier work there are some beautiful harmonic
      effects; in the later, contrapuntal phrases sometimes occur; an animated
      rapid accompaniment by the violins is common to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the Litany, the Pignus futurÃ¦ gloriÃ¦, so in the Vesper the fourth
      psalm, Laudate pueri, was treated in severe counterpoint, and here it was
      that a thoroughly trained church composer made good his claim to the
      title. In the first of the Vespers that we are considering this psalm<a
      href="#linknote-210011" name="linknoteref-210011" id="linknoteref-210011">
      11 </a> is a clever piece of counterpoint, original in form, and deviating
      from the strict regularity which usually characterises Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It begins with an infinite canon. The twelve bars melody for the soprano&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      is imitated three bars later by the alto in unison. Then follows the tenor
      an octave higher, and then the bass in unison. After the completion of the
      melody the soprano again takes it up, alto and tenor follow. The regular
      progress of the canon is then broken by a complete final cadenza, in which
      all the voices unite on the last note of the bass melody. A short theme
      introduced by the bass&mdash;[See Page Image] <span class="side">LAUDATE
      PUERI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p099.png">[99]</a></span>
      is imitated by the other parts in similar or in contrary motion, and soon
      passes over into a short passage ending in D minor. Hereupon the soprano
      interposes with a new and characteristic melody&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      the first bars of which are taken up by the other voices; but instead of a
      further elaboration, a new theme is introduced by the alto, followed by a
      counter-theme, which are both imitated together&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      whereupon the alto raises a new melody, which is figured by the other
      parts in imitation as Cantus firmus, and closes in A minor. Then the alto
      begins with the previous soprano subject, but now in F major; the soprano
      follows with the second, but the imitative figuring soon gives place to a
      fine harmonic elaboration, followed by the third passage; the imitative
      parts maintain the same character, and the alto has now another Cantus
      firmus. To this at last is appended a long coda, formed of detachments of
      previous subjects, variously elaborated in stretto and contrary motion,
      ending in organ point on the dominant. It cannot fail to be remarked how
      tuneful and melodious, as well as independent, characteristic, and
      striking in their effect are the different parts. The melodies which
      compose the Cantus firmus may have been, in part at least, borrowed from
      church tones. Far more ambitious is the contrapuntal work in the second
      Vesper,<a href="#linknote-210012" name="linknoteref-210012"
      id="linknoteref-210012"> 12 </a> which consists of a close succession of
      <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p100.png">[100]</a></span> difficult problems solved after
      the severest and most rigorous rules. After the first regular enunciation
      of the theme&mdash;[See Page Images] there occurs a second motif&mdash;which
      is at first treated freely, and issues into a short harmonic passage,
      which is afterwards used again as an interlude. Then the two motifs are
      combined&mdash;[See Page Image] and elaborated together, after which this
      section closes on the chord of the dominant in a stretto arrangement of
      the chief subject, while the violins take up the subordinate motif. When
      the chief subject has again asserted itself, there follows its inversion
      as a counter-subject&mdash;and regular elaboration, ending in the above
      interlude, after which the subject and its inversion appear together as an
      organ point on the fundamental tone, while the violins proceed with an
      independent accompaniment:&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      After the previous stretto has again occurred on the chord of the dominant
      the two first subjects reappear in new <span class="side">LAUDATE DOMINUM
      AND MAGNIFICAT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p101.png">[101]</a></span>
      original climacteric treatment, divided between the voices and the
      accompaniment;&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      A free conclusion brings the artistic and forcible work to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if for refreshment after this effort, the fifth psalm, Lau-date
      Dominum, is treated as a solo movement of a pleasing character. In the
      earlier vesper it is a soprano solo with organ obbligato, not certainly
      set in prescribed aria form, but in its brilliant passages and easy
      grouping of the melodies more akin to secular music than any other of
      Mozart's church compositions of this period. In the second vesper the
      psalm has a more solemn character, but even here it is a mild and tender
      soprano solo, somewhat pastoral in tone, and supported by a solo bassoon;
      simple throughout, and with a fine climax at the close, the doxology being
      sung by the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virgin's hymn of praise, "Magnificat anima mea," which forms the
      conclusion of the Vespers, is by its form the part best fitted for musical
      rendering. But the connection in which it here stands with the preceding
      psalms obliges a corresponding treatment both as to extent and conception.
      We must not therefore look either for a comprehensive treatment giving
      free development to the details of the separate sentences, such as is to
      be found in the Magnificats of some great masters, or for such an amount
      of dramatic characterisation as the words give scope for. The text is
      tersely and precisely treated, with the avowed intention of concluding the
      work with a movement in contrast to the <span class="side">COURT SERVICE
      IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p102.png">[102]</a></span>
      first psalm. This is evident not only in the external arrangement, which
      introduces trumpets and drums, and returns to the original key, but in the
      technical treatment and the closely allied tone of expression. The
      expression of firm and cheerful confidence, which is common to both, is
      naturally accentuated in the Magnificat in accordance with the text, and
      the lively expectation of the first psalm is now turned into thanksgiving
      for its fulfilment. The technical treatment of the Magnificat is
      consistently more important and animated, especially in the extended use
      of the forms of counterpoint; but in the main the two compositions have
      the same tone and colour, and the same condensed and impulsive style. The
      words "Magnificat anima mea Dominum" form a solemn introduction as a short
      slow movement; "Et exultavit" is in quicker tempo, which is maintained to
      the end, chorus and solo alternating in the usual way. Here again it is to
      be noticed that different points are accentuated in the earlier Magnificat
      chiefly by harmonic means, in the second chiefly by counterpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having in these works followed Mozart's steady upward progress along the
      path which he had previously entered on, a progress maintained against
      most unfavourable surroundings, let us now turn to his attempts in the new
      province of music as an adjunct to the drama. Remembering his intense
      desire to write for the stage, a desire which had been increased by the
      manifold influences of his travels, we shall not be surprised that even
      theatrical undertakings in Salzburg offered him the opportunity he sought.
      When he returned home a theatrical company was performing under BÃ¶hm's
      management; in 1780 we find Shikaneder there with his travelling <i>troupe</i>,
      a friend of the Mozart family, joining in their quoit contests and quite
      ready to turn Wolfgang's talents to his own advantage.<a

      Menes, King of Egypt, has been deposed by a usurper, Rameses, and as it is
      thought, assassinated; but he is living under the name of Sethos as high
      priest of the Temple of the Sun, the secret being known only to the priest
      Hammon and the general Phanes. After the death of Rameses his son Thamos
      is heir to the throne. The day arrives when Thamos attains majority, is to
      be invested with the diadem, and to select a bride. The friends of Menes
      seek in vain to persuade him to dispute the throne. He will not oppose the
      noble youth whom he loves and esteems. But Pheron, a prince and confidant
      of Thamos has, in conjunction with Mirza, the chief of the virgins of the
      sun, organised a conspiracy against Thamos, and won over a portion of the
      army. Tharsis, daughter of Menes, who is believed by all, even her father,
      to be dead, has been brought up by Mirza under the name of Sais. It is
      arranged that she shall be proclaimed rightful heir to the throne, and as
      she will then have the right to choose her consort, Mirza will secure her
      beforehand for Pheron. When she discovers that Sais loves Thamos, and he
      her, she induces Sais to believe that Thamos prefers her playmate Myris,
      and Sais is generous enough to sacrifice her love and her hopes of the
      throne to her friend. Equally nobly Thamos rejects all suspicions against
      Pheron, and awards him supreme command. As the time for action draws near,
      Pheron discloses to Sethos, whom he takes for a devoted follower of Menes,
      and consequently for an enemy to Thamos, the secret of Sais' existence and
      his own plans. Sethos prepares secretly to save Thamos. Sais also, after
      being pledged to silence by an oath, is initiated into the secret by Mirza
      and Pheron, and directed to choose Pheron. She declines to give a decided
      answer, and Pheron announces to Mirza his determination to seize the
      throne by force in case of extremity. Sais, who believes herself not loved
      by Thamos, and will not therefore choose him as consort, but will not
      deprive him of the throne, takes the solemn and irrevocable oath as virgin
      of the sun. Thamos enters, and they discover to their sorrow their mutual
      love. Sethos, entering, enlightens Thamos as to the treachery of Pheron,
      without disclosing the parentage of Sais. Pheron, disturbed by the report
      that Menes is <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p104.png">[104]</a></span> still living,
      comes to take council of Sethos, and adheres to his treacherous design. In
      solemn assembly Thamos is about to be declared king, when Mirza reveals
      the fact that Sais is the lost Tharsis, and heiress to the throne. Thamos
      is the first to offer her his homage. When she is constrained to choose
      between Thamos and Pheron she declares herself bound by her oath, and
      announces Thamos as the possessor of the throne. Then Pheron calls his
      followers to arms, but Sethos steps forward and discloses himself as
      Menes; whereupon all fall at his feet in joyful emotion. Pheron is
      disarmed and led off, Mirza stabs herself, Menes, as father and ruler,
      releases Sais from her oath, unites her with Thamos, and places the pair
      on the throne. A message arrives that Pheron has been struck with
      lightning by Divine judgment, and the piece ends.

      Mozart wrote music to this drama at Salzburg in 1779 or 1780, according to
      the evidence of the handwriting and paper of the score, as well as of the
      treatment of the orchestra.<a href="#linknote-210016"
      name="linknoteref-210016" id="linknoteref-210016"> 16 </a> It consisted at
      first of four instrumental movements which were played between the acts,
      and one which formed the conclusion of the whole piece. It was not a new
      idea to compose appropriate music to a drama of importance instead of the
      usual indifferent or inappropriate instrumental movements. Joh. Ad.
      Scheibe (1708-1776) wrote music for "Polyeucte" and "Mithridate" in 1738,
      and afterwards wrote an article on this kind of music in the "Kritischen
      Musicus." He maintained that the overture should be composed with
      reference to the whole piece, and should lead up to its commencement; that
      the symphonies between the acts should be connected both with the act
      which preceded and that which followed, so as to lead the audience
      insensibly from the one frame of mind to the other. The closing symphony
      should be in close relationship to the end of the piece, so as to
      intensify the impression made by the <i>denouement</i> upon the audience.
      He <span class="side">ENTR'ACTES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p105.png">[105]</a></span> considered a change of
      instruments particularly necessary, in order to keep up the attention of
      the audience; but care must be taken to select the most appropriate
      instruments for each movement, so as to express what had to be expressed
      in the most effective manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scheibe was followed by Joh. Christ. Hertel (1726-1789) with the music to
      Cronegk's "Olint and Sophronia,"<a href="#linknote-210017"
      name="linknoteref-210017" id="linknoteref-210017"> 17 </a> and by others
      (among them Agricola) with the music to "Semi-ramis" (after Voltaire),
      which Lessing thought worthy of an analysis, and declared his opinion that
      the entr'actes should have no reference to the following act, but should
      only amplify and conclude what had gone before.<a href="#linknote-210018"
      name="linknoteref-210018" id="linknoteref-210018"> 18 </a> Vogler's
      overture and entr'actes to "Hamlet" were given in Mannheim in 1779.<a
      href="#linknote-210019" name="linknoteref-210019" id="linknoteref-210019">
      19 </a> Even in Salzburg M. Haydn had composed in 1777 special music for
      the performance of Voltaire's "Zaire" by French actors, which was received
      with great applause.<a href="#linknote-210020" name="linknoteref-210020"
      id="linknoteref-210020"> 20 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The music to "King Thamos" has, curiously enough, no overture, which is
      perhaps accounted for by the fact that the play begins with a chorus, and
      so is opened by music.<a href="#linknote-210021" name="linknoteref-210021"
      id="linknoteref-210021"> 21 </a> Each <i>entr'acte</i> is in connection
      with the last scene of the preceding act, and seeks to express the same
      set of emotions by means of music; Mozart has each time noted down what
      seemed to him the prevailing idea to be represented. Thus, he writes
      concerning the first movement: "The first act ends with the determination
      of Mirza and Pheron to place the latter <span class="side">COURT SERVICE
      IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p106.png">[106]</a></span>
      on the throne." Upon the last words of Mirza&mdash;"Mirza, a woman,
      trembles not. Thou art a man; conquer, or die!"&mdash;the orchestra
      strikes in with three solemn chords, the effect heightened by long pauses;
      then begins a restless and agitated Allegro (in C minor). The prevailing
      tone is one of excitement, and those who were in the theatre might well
      receive the suggestion of Mirza, as an eager passionate woman, inciting
      Pheron to action; but the characterisation is not very striking. It is
      only noticeable that the separate phrases of the subject are shorter and
      in greater contrast than is usual with Mozart; otherwise we have before us
      a movement in two parts, with a coda arranged in the ordinary manner, but
      not elaborated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second act has, if possible, a still more general application: "The
      noble nature of Thamos is displayed at the end of the second act; the
      third act opens with Thamos and the traitor Pheron," and the dialogue
      wherein Thamos declares his belief in Pheron's fidelity, and resigns Sais
      to him, while Pheron continues to dissemble. Here, too, Mozart has written
      an ordinary movement in two parts (Andante, E flat major); but he has
      resorted to the expedient of denoting the character of the two personages
      by means of distinct subjects, which he indicates by superscriptions:&mdash;[See
      page images]
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">ENTR'ACTES TO KÃ”NIG THAMOS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p107.png">[107]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to be seen here that musical contrast is the main point, and
      that the characterisation is very general, quite apart from the fact that
      integrity and hypocrisy cannot be expressed in music, as Mozart was well
      aware, in spite of his naÃ¯ve superscriptions. The inadequacy of such <span
      class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p108.png">[108]</a></span> characterisation is shown in the
      second part, where both characters occur together:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the expression has become still more general, and we have only the
      musical development of a given subject, not the progress of a dramatic
      situation; more than this it is out of the province of the musician to
      give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestions for the music of the third <i>entr'acte</i> are more
      promising. The music is connected in the first place with the last scene:
      44 The third act closes with the treacherous dialogue between Mirza and
      Pheron,,, expressed by means of an agitated, strongly accented Allegro,
      which, however, soon breaks off, and dies away. Thereupon the music turns
      to the fourth act, which begins with the vow of the deluded Sais. Here the
      influence of the melodrama upon Mozart becomes apparent, for he follows
      with his music every turn in the monologue of Sais, indicating each by a
      superscription. We may, indeed, doubt whether he had not some idea of a
      melodramatic delivery of the music, although there are no pauses left for
      spoken sentences, and the flow of the music, notwithstanding frequent
      changes of time is uninterrupted. This movement would be most open to the
      adverse criticism of Lessing, for it anticipates the whole of the
      following scene. In itself it is the most expressive and the most
      successful; in spite of its division into separate points it preserves
      connection and <span class="side">ENTR'ACTES TO KÃ–NIG THAMOS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p109.png">[109]</a></span> unity, and a
      tone of tender grace such as becomes a bashful maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth <i>entr'acte</i> is again an animated movement (Allegro vivace
      assai) which is to depict "the universal confusion" with which the fourth
      act concludes. We can recognise in the wild, restless subject, in
      opposition to which is placed another full of dignity and reserve, the
      intended contrast between the conspirators and Thamos with his followers;
      but we need, of course, to be told what it is that the music means to
      represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the spectators were in a position to transfer the factitious
      presumption from the stage to the music, a general characterisation would
      suffice for them. The music therefore fulfils its primary aim, but it has
      undertaken a task which lies beyond its province, and a previous knowledge
      of the subject treated is indispensable to the due appreciation of it; in
      this way the music is as dependent as though it were a setting to words
      without the advantage of the direct intelligibleness given to it by words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing movement describes "Pheron's despair, blasphemy, and death."
      As this situation coincides with a fearful thunderstorm, the musical
      characterisation is confined to a representation of it without any
      dramatic detail; it is a wildly forcible movement, and the effect accords
      well with the suggested idea.<a href="#linknote-210022"
      name="linknoteref-210022" id="linknoteref-210022"> 22 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unquestionable that Mozart, excited by the melodrama, has set
      himself eagerly to express dramatic details in music, and yet in almost
      every case the exigencies of musical construction have been too much for
      him. The impressions he has received from the drama become only impulses,
      leading him to accent more sharply and set in stronger contrast the
      various points of his composition; the special points of the dramatic
      situations are not fully brought out in the music. This is in great
      measure the fault of the play, which affords few powerful or effective
      suggestions to the composer either through its characters or its
      situations; <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p110.png">[110]</a></span> great
      poetical or dramatic power would no doubt have called forth other music.
      That such a play should have been received with interest and applause,<a
      href="#linknote-210023" name="linknoteref-210023" id="linknoteref-210023">
      23 </a> that it should have incited Mozart to composition, is a speaking
      proof of the taste of the time. Shakespeare and Goethe had not yet
      penetrated the intellectual atmosphere in which Mozart had grown up;
      before poetry could assert its sway in the province of music it had to
      express and realise the demand for a characterisation bringing to view the
      most individual traits of human character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gebler had sought to invest his drama with peculiar dignity by providing
      it with choruses, for which Racine's "Athalie" may have furnished him with
      an example. The play begins with a solemn sacrifice in the Temple of the
      Sun, the priests and virgins singing hymns to the Godhead; in the same
      way, at the beginning of the fifth act, the coronation of the king is
      introduced by a sacrifice, the priests and virgins again singing a hymn.<a
      href="#linknote-210024" name="linknoteref-210024" id="linknoteref-210024">
      24 </a> These choruses gave Mozart opportunity for a magnificent style of
      composition, with all the brilliancy that external support could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymns were well-known ones with Latin words inserted later, for which,
      however, a German translation was again substituted. Our judgment as to
      style and conception <span class="side">CHORUSES TO KONIG THAMOS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p111.png">[111]</a></span> will
      naturally be affected by the fact that the hymns were written for the
      theatre, and not as church music proper; and yet these very hymns have
      been widely circulated by countless performances in churches, and are made
      to serve as the principal evidence of Mozart's style of church music.
      There is no question that their whole conception is grander, freer, and
      more imposing than that of any of his masses belonging to that period, but
      this is because he felt himself unfettered by conventional restrictions. A
      solemn act of worship was represented on the stage, the expression of
      reverence to the Supreme Being was heightened in effect by the Egyptian
      surroundings; and Mozart's endeavour was to render the consequent emotions
      with all possible truth and force. But he was fully conscious that the
      expression must be <i>dramatic</i>. Therefore everything was avoided that
      directly suggested the church, and an impression of splendour and
      brilliancy was given which in this fashion was foreign to the church;
      above all the subjective points of sentiment are thrown into strong
      relief, and forcibly expressed. But although there is an essential
      difference between these choruses and Mozart's contemporary church music,
      yet we cannot fail to perceive a certain amount of resemblance in the
      manner in which the solemnity and importance of religious ceremony is
      rendered both here and in the "ZauberflÃ¶te." The drama itself has some
      resemblance to the "ZauberflÃ¶te," both in its deistic-humani-tarian
      tendency and its Egyptian costume and sun-worship. Freemasonry may have
      exerted some influence over Gebler's mind<a href="#linknote-210025"
      name="linknoteref-210025" id="linknoteref-210025"> 25 </a>&mdash;it could
      have had none at that time over Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the music to the "ZauberflÃ¶te" everything, more especially the power of
      concentrating ideas in the strictest forms, shows mature development,
      while here we are aware of the youthful genius, rejoiced at the
      opportunity of pouring forth his best in full measure, and thereby
      satisfying his nature to the utmost. The consideration of these choruses
      explains his joy at finding the chorus in Paris strong and good, <span
      class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p112.png">[112]</a></span> (Vol. I., p. 429), and choruses,
      his "most favourite compositions," well performed and much thought of; we
      can imagine what he would have made of the choruses if he had written a
      grand opera in Paris. They leave Gebler's words (out of which, according
      to Wieland, Gluck could have made something excellent) so far behind that
      the music and the poetry, considered from an artistic point of view, seem
      to belong to different periods. For actual representation they are no
      doubt too grandly and broadly conceived and executed; they overpower the
      whole drama with their weight. The impression of solemnity and grandeur
      produced on the mind by symbolic ceremonies is rendered with dignity, and
      at the same time with fire and energy. The chorus and orchestra unite to
      give the effect of splendour and magnificence, and startling harmonies are
      borne along as if on an irresistible stream; the lighter subordinate
      subjects (divided between male and female chorus as well as solo voices)
      are less marked. The style and treatment of the choruses have afforded a
      precedent for many similar works in later days; so also has the way in
      which the choruses and a full orchestra are united so as to give a massive
      effect, both of arrangement and construction. Mozart himself had no
      opportunity of again uniting chorus and orchestra on a large scale, and
      proceeding further in the same direction; Haydn in his oratorios inherited
      this portion of Mozart's genius, and numerous efforts have since been made
      to accomplish what Mozart began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra is provided with all the external advantages that Salzburg
      could offer; no instruments employed at a later date are wanting, except
      the clarinet, which Mozart missed so sensibly. It is organised and
      constructed exactly as we find it at the present day; the wind instruments
      of wood and brass and the stringed instruments are united in definite
      groups, but in perfect freedom of treatment. Most striking is Mozart's
      progress in his treatment of the brass instruments. The trombones are no
      longer with the voices, and where they support them they do it in an
      independent manner, generally by sustained chords. But they also take
      their own place in the orchestra, the horns and trumpets united with them,
      and <span class="side">CHORUSES TO KÃ–NIG THAMOS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p113.png">[113]</a></span> then again
      the horns combine with the wood-wind instruments; while the trumpets, with
      the drums, occasionally assert their peculiar character. In the same way,
      the other wind instruments are combined among themselves, as well as with
      the other instruments; it is in accordance with their nature that the
      rendering of the more delicate details should fall to their share. Such an
      extended employment of the wind instruments must naturally have influenced
      the treatment of the strings. These are independently and forcibly placed
      in contrast with the wind instruments, so that, while the latter heighten
      the colouring, the former determine the fundamental character of the work
      and maintain unity of tone. In short, all important effects which can be
      produced by different combinations of the instruments are here brought
      into use, not merely as sound effects produced by changes of tone
      colouring, but as the means of giving due expression to musical ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus also takes a different position in conjunction with an
      orchestra such as this. It is no longer the principal object in the sense
      of making everything else subservient to itself; but the independence of
      the instruments renders it freer in its own motion. Since so much was left
      to be rendered by the orchestra, the chorus was able to characterise what
      belonged essentially to it all the more sharply and strongly; and the
      powerful and effective orchestra called forth all the strength of the
      chorus that they might keep pace with each other. For this there was
      requisite, besides an intensified meaning in the subjects, a free and
      melodious treatment, which made the separate voices the foundation for the
      display of natural and forcible effects of sound. To satisfy these varied
      conditions in detail, and to unite them harmoniously into combined effect,
      has been Mozart's successfully executed task. Let any one place those
      earlier works, in which the voices supply the harmonies to a continuous
      violin passage and a <i>basso continuo</i> side by side with these hymns
      where an independent chorus, complete in itself, is united with an equally
      independent and carefully arranged orchestra, so as to form a compact and
      solid whole, and what an extraordinary progress is apparent!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p114.png">[114]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart, who executed this work with loving care, composed both choruses
      twice over. The first chorus, in the earlier and completely carried-out
      attempt, has essentially the same features as the later, only the solo
      parts are simpler and without the delicate accompaniment which gives them
      their chief charm. The voices are only altered in the details of the main
      portions of the chorus, but the orchestra is subjected to a thorough
      elaboration. At first there were no flutes, and the addition of these has
      given to the oboes a different position and in many ways caused a
      different grouping of the instruments. But, apart from this, there are so
      many improvements in detail that this work may be considered as a regular
      study in instrumentation. The difference between the two versions of the
      second chorus are more essential. Only the beginning and the fundamental
      ideas of some of the subjects in the first attempt are identical with the
      later elaboration. The working-out is quite different, not only much
      shorter, but in every respect scantier and less important; and more
      especially are the orchestral parts far removed from their present rich
      perfection. Mozart did not even finish this first attempt; it breaks off
      in the middle of the last passage, although only a few bars are wanting.
      The difference in the elaboration proves once more that the true gift of
      an artist consists in the unerring judgment with which, after no matter
      how many experiments in the process of his work, he seizes in the end on
      what is best for his purpose. It is instructive to follow the progress of
      development from the earlier ideas and attempts&mdash;in the second chorus
      the main features are more carefully perfected, in the first the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent effect of these two choruses seems to have suggested the
      idea of bringing the drama to an impressive close by means of another
      chorus. In the place of the instrumental movement which represented
      Pheron's death, there was introduced a short exhortation by the High
      Priest to fear the Divine wrath, which is taken up by the chorus, and
      passes into joyful trust in the protection of the Almighty.

      Mozart's composition (to words provided by a Salzburg

    <p>

      name="linknoteref-210026" id="linknoteref-210026"> 26 </a> is altogether
      worthy of the two first hymns. The bass solo of the High Priest
      foreshadows the Commendatore in "Don Giovanni." The chorus which follows
      gives the right expression of humble reverence on the part of the
      bystanders; and the cheerful dignity of the conclusion is quite
      appropriate when we take into account that the chorus was intended for the
      stage and not for the church.

    <p>
      Another composition falling within Mozart's present residence at Salzburg
      is a German operetta, for which honest Schachtner provided the libretto.
      It was almost finished when Mozart went to Munich in November, 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father wrote (December 11, 1780) that nothing could then be done with
      "Schachtner's play" on account of the public mourning at Vienna. This was
      all the better, since "the music was not quite ready." But Wolfgang begs
      him (January 18, 1781) to bring with him "Schachtner's operetta." "People
      come to see Cannabich, with whom the hearing of such things does not come
      <i>mal Ã¤ propos</i>." Later on the father revived the idea of producing
      the operetta in Vienna, but Wolfgang answered (April 18,1781): "Nothing
      can be done with Schachtner's operetta, for the same reason that I have
      often given before. I could not contradict Stephanie; I could only say
      that the piece&mdash;except the long dialogues, which could easily be
      altered&mdash;was very good, but not suited for Vienna, where they only
      care for comic pieces."

      Gomaz has been betrayed into the power of the Sultan Soliman and set to
      servile tasks. He has won the love of Zaide, who is in the seraglio of the
      Sultan, but the passion of the latter for her affords little hope to the
      lovers. Finding Gomaz, overcome with toil, asleep in the garden, she
      leaves him her likeness. This leads to a declaration of their mutual love.
      To them attaches himself Alazim, the Sultan's favourite, and apparently
      the overseer of the slaves, who represents the humane and enlightened
      Mussulman. He procures for them Turkish dresses, and accompanies them in
      their flight. At the beginning of the second act we find the Sultan in
      violent wrath at the treachery he has just discovered. He rages against
      the fugitives, whom Zaram undertakes to pursue and capture. They are, in
      fact, soon brought back, and Soliman is not moved to clemency either by
      the prayers and constancy of Zaide, or by the exhortations of Alazim. In
      what way a happy <i>denouement</i> is at last brought about cannot be
      conjectured.<a href="#linknote-210030" name="linknoteref-210030"

      This serious operetta is written in the manner and after the scale of the
      vaudeville of the time; it does not depend upon the executive powers of
      the performers nor upon large expedients, and the standard throughout is a
      modest one. The orchestral combinations prove that it was intended for
      performance in Salzburg, and the treatment of the separate parts may have
      had reference to the available <i>personnel</i>.

      Zaide lays no claim to anything but a certain amount of fluency. The part
      of the Sultan requires a strong penetrating voice, but for the rest the
      requirements of the music are well within the compass of ordinary
      theatrical singers; musical feeling, and a natural, correct judgment
      Mozart always displays, because they were in fact a part of himself which
      could not be laid aside.

    <p>
      In the construction of the songs the traditional arrangement of the
      Italian aria is not closely adhered to. An effort is evident to make use
      of the fundamental law requiring contrasting motifs to be compacted into a
      whole, in developing the individuality of the characters and of the
      dramatic situations. Nevertheless, the influence of the old tradition is
      visible in many phenomena, such as the change of tempo, the long
      ritomelli, the division of the different motifs by regular rests, and
      their amplification. Yet it is no longer servile obedience to an external
      type, but an evident determination to evolve the form out of the given
      situation.

      Every artist, no matter how many-sided his genius, feels his nature
      impelled in a certain direction in which his creative strength works
      freely and independently, while other paths remain strange to him or are
      altogether closed. Experience and cultivation go far to equalise his
      powers, but they are powerless to alter the original impulse. Now dramatic
      representation makes demands upon the artist for the satisfaction of which
      he must not indeed overstep the bounds of his individuality&mdash;that no
      man can do with impunity&mdash;but he must stretch them to their extremest
      limits. Here it is that he seeks aid from the poet. The latter can elevate
      the musician by the strength and vividness of his situation and
      characters, by the style and vigour of his language, while it needs but
      little to stimulate his musical production to activity. This aid was
      denied to Mozart when as a young man he first sought to write dramatic
      music in its true sense. The first act of the opera before us has no
      events except the love passages between Gomaz and Zaide, which take their
      peculiar tone from the mixture of pity for suffering innocence and from
      the danger threatening in the background. Here Mozart is quite in his
      element. The <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p118.png">[118]</a></span> tendency and
      fervour of his own sentiments are involuntarily expressed; but, graceful
      and interesting as is this first act, the poetical expression of the words
      discovers nothing of the more delicate features of the music. Again, in
      the second act, the Sultan raging in jealousy, Zaide at first beseeching,
      then also furious, Alazim moralising&mdash;these are elements in the
      treatment of which Mozart might well look for aid from the poet. And here
      it was that the poet left him in the lurch altogether. We fancy ourselves
      in a marionette-show when the Sultan sings:&mdash;

      The music totters under the weight of such words as these. The songs,
      which follow one after the other, are indeed well conceived and carefully
      executed, and even for the most part characteristic; but their
      characterisation is all external, and when suggested by different touches
      in the text it is rarely happy. There is a want of harmony and balance, as
      well as of impulse and warmth, so that the really beautiful separate ideas
      have no proportionate effect. It is remarkable that these songs are all
      too long, and their cadenzas are especially tedious, as if quantity was to
      make up for quality. Further adherence to the antiquated aria form is
      particularly noticeable; as if, when the musical construction no longer
      proceeded directly from the impulse <span class="side">ZAIDE&mdash;QUARTET.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p119.png">[119]</a></span> of the
      dramatic situation, the old forms involuntarily asserted their sway. The
      quartet (16) in which the musical and dramatic interest is, as it were,
      concentrated, contrasts very favourably with the solo songs. The <i>dramatis
      personÃ¦</i> are all happily characterised; the Sultan, implacable in his
      anger, Gomaz seeking to console Zaide, who, in her turn, strives to
      purchase his life by the sacrifice of her own, and Aiazim, overcome with
      grief at being unable to see a way out of the complications that he
      himself has brought about. Here too we have a conflict of opposing
      emotions faithfully and accurately delineated, and all directed to one
      central point; it is, in fact, a situation which fulfils all the essential
      conditions of musical representation. Here then Mozart is in his element.
      The different characters are drawn with a steady hand, every emotion is
      definitely and accurately expressed, and the elements thus gained are
      employed as materials for a construction which is as faithful to the laws
      of musical organisation as to the requirements of the dramatic situation.
      The quartet thus fulfils the two essential conditions of dramatic music,
      and reveals itself as a consistent and harmonious piece of work, the
      separate motifs of which are beautiful and expressive, while the interest
      is kept alive by alternation and climax, and a vivid dramatic picture is
      produced by the artistic treatment of musical forms. The grouping of the
      voices in manifold variety of combination displays, as if on a ground
      plan, a symmetrical, well-disposed musical edifice. As they proceed they
      develop out of the simplest situations the most varied shades of
      sentiment, so that the music carries into the innermost recesses of the
      mind and heart what the words have merely hinted at. Even the actual
      musical formulas, such as the entry of the voices in imitation, produce,
      in the right place, such a direct and vivid effect that they appear to
      have been invented for the special case. As to the main conception on
      which the construction of the quartet rests, it might, if the violent rage
      of the Sultan were considered as the chief point, have been made more
      passionate and agitated without overstepping truth of expression; but
      Mozart has in preference emphasised the more fervid and reserved <span
      class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p120.png">[120]</a></span> emotions of the other
      characters, to which the expression of anger must be subordinated. This
      conception has perhaps been suggested by the greater ease which it
      afforded for the introduction of the necessary reconciliation of the
      characters; partly, also, a more quiet and contained piece might appear to
      be of better effect after so many lively and agitated songs; it is
      certain, however, that it was the conception most in accordance with
      Mozart's nature as an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally in accord with the situation, but not by any means so deep and
      expressive, is the terzet (8) which brings the first act to a conclusion.
      In this there is no conflict of sentiment; Zaide, Gomaz and Alazim are
      happy in the feeling of mutual love and friendship, and in the hope of a
      speedy deliverance; the fear lest their plan of escape should fail casts
      only a passing shadow on their cheerful frame of mind.<a
      href="#linknote-210031" name="linknoteref-210031" id="linknoteref-210031">
      31 </a> The music therefore expresses content and happiness with great
      tenderness and the purest melody, especially in the first movement. The
      duet between Zaide and Gomaz (5), whose love is not a stormy passion, but
      the devotion of two noble beings, expresses in the most delightful manner
      the purity and openness of a happy affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are not wanting, either such delicate features of detail as
      characterise the genuine musical dramatist. For instance, in Gomaz' song
      (6), when he is divided between gratitude to Alazim and impatience to
      hasten to Zaide, there is charming humour in his confusion, particularly
      at the words "doch ich muss dich schnell verlassen," and "lass dich
      kÃ¼ssen, lass dich drÃ¼cken," which in no way interferes with the more
      serious sentiment of the song as a whole. The union of humour and
      sentiment at the close is excellent. While the accompaniment continues the
      last subject, Gomaz, who had rushed off in hot haste, turns back, and
      sings once more with heartfelt emotion: "Herr und Freund, wie dank' ich
      dir!" There is a pretty touch in Osmin's air (11) where the purely musical
      return to the theme is used to express recurring bursts of hearty
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workmanship of the opera, both as regards the <span class="side">ZAIDE&mdash;ORCHESTRA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p121.png">[121]</a></span>
      treatment of the voices and of the orchestra, is, as might be expected,
      thorough and sure. The orchestra deserves special notice. We find only the
      instruments in use at Salzburg, and the wind instruments are sparingly
      employed. The flutes and oboes generally alternate, but they are together
      and in conjunction with bassoons and horns in the quartet(16) and in one
      of the Sultan's airs (12); trumpets and drums are only used in the
      Sultan's raging scene (9). Many songs (1, 11, 13) are accompanied by
      stringed instruments alone. The hand of a master is recognisable
      throughout, in the life and movement which we follow with unflagging
      interest, in the force and beauty of the sound effects, and in the
      delicacy of the lights and shades. Many touches recall later works of
      Mozart; but these for the most part consist in turns of expression, in the
      treatment of the accompaniment, &amp;c. One decided reminiscence is not
      without interest. The quartet is introduced by a short passage for the
      wind instruments, which recurs several times in the course of the piece,
      whereupon the voices enter as follows:&mdash;[See Page Image] <span
      class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p122.png">[122]</a></span> where it appears in the song of
      Constanze, "Traurigkeit ward mir zum Loose" (10) in the following form:&mdash;[See
      Page Imge]
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternate rendering of the subject by the voices and accompaniment,
      and the alternation between the wind instruments, give it a new charm; and
      it is not without intention that the instrumentation here is less full
      than in the former case.
    </p>

      One peculiarity of this operetta is the introduction of melodrama. J. J.
      Rousseau, in his production of "Pygmalion" at Lyons in 1770 and Paris in
      1775, gave the first example of a dramatic piece in which spoken dialogue
      was interspersed with music in the nature of obbligato recitatives.<a
      href="#linknote-210032" name="linknoteref-210032" id="linknoteref-210032">
      32 </a> The attempt thus to render music effective as a means of dramatic
      expression was successful, although the critics raised objections to the
      union of music and speech.<a href="#linknote-210033"

      Independently of Rousseau's experiment, it had occurred to Brandes in 1772
      at Weimar to adapt Gerstenberg's cantate "Ariadne" as a melodrama for his
      wife, who was an excellent actress, but no musician. Schweitzer undertook
      the composition, but owing to the interruption caused by his "Alceste" he
      did not finish it.<a href="#linknote-210034" name="linknoteref-210034"
      id="linknoteref-210034"> 34 </a> When Brandes removed to Gotha in 1775, he

      id="linknoteref-210035"> 35 </a> The extraordinary success it met with

    <p>
      Mozart's idea of substituting melodrama for accompanied recitative in
      German opera was a kindred one (Vol. II., p. 74), and the same idea is
      evident in other directions.<a href="#linknote-210041"
      name="linknoteref-210041" id="linknoteref-210041"> 41 </a> It is put into
      practice in "Zaide." Two important monologues are melodramatically
      treated; one by Gomaz at the beginning of the first, and another by
      Soliman at the beginning of <span class="side">COURT SERVICE IN SALZBURG.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p124.png">[124]</a></span> the
      second act.<a href="#linknote-210042" name="linknoteref-210042"
      id="linknoteref-210042"> 42 </a> Benda's composition has evidently been
      taken as a model; the music in short periods, often only in detached
      chords, follows each turn of the monologue, and seeks to give expression
      to the lightest shades of sentiment. The musical treatment is essentially
      different from that of obbligato recitative, where the independent
      instrumental passages are connected partly by the recitative itself, which
      is always sung, partly by the harmonies of the accompaniment; in the
      melodrama, on the other hand, every passage, even the smallest, is treated
      as distinctly apart. In the recitatives, again, which are sung, the
      lighter shades of sentiment may be rendered by cadence, rhythm, or
      harmony, without the intervention of any instrumental passages. In the
      melodrama this is impossible, and in order to accentuate details, the
      continuity of the dialogue must be sacrificed; another decided and almost
      inevitable drawback is the dependence upon details for characterisation,
      which is thereby often out of proportion. In this way, spoken dialogue
      loses its chief means of effect&mdash;that is, its continuity of idea&mdash;while
      nothing is gained for musical unity, which ought to make up for all
      deficiencies by the steady maintenance of a sustained mood. For, impelled
      as Mozart might be by his nature to gather into a whole the shattered
      members of this musical representation by means of rhythmical combinations
      and harmonic progressions, this was only possible to a limited degree, and
      musical construction in its proper sense can only exist in those few
      places where the music is independent of the melodrama. The main point,
      however, cannot be denied, which is that the words and the music are not
      here so blended that each part is richly repaid for what it sacrifices by
      its union with the other, but that each is continually asserting itself in
      opposition to the other, so that both are in fact the losers. To
    </p>
    <p>
      It is particularly to be regretted that the original words for these
      melodramatic scenes have not been printed. The alterations in Soliman's
      monologue are not so essential, but Gomaz's monologue is entirely
      transformed. In the original text he was absorbed by his unpleasant
      position; when he prays for refreshing slumber, and the music represents
      his repeated starting up from rest, the altered version puts love-ravings
      for Zaide into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">ZAIDE&mdash;MELODRAMA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p125.png">[125]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      To this may be added the great difficulty of satisfying the requirements
      of music, together with those of declamatory speech, and of filling the
      pauses with suitable gestures and movements, the amount of histrionic art
      necessary being rarely possessed by singers. Benda's melodramas were
      written for distinguished actresses, whose forte lay in their declamation
      and action; the situations were selected with this view, the dialogue was
      constructed in accordance with it; in fact, each scene was self-contained,
      not incorporated as a component part of a greater whole. Objections of
      this kind must have acted upon Mozart at a later time; at all events, he
      never again employed melodrama, not even in the "Zauberflote," when the
      occasion seemed ready to hand. It was nevertheless often introduced into
      operas&mdash;and partially also into plays&mdash;with very good effect.
      But the effect relies chiefly either on the material impressions of sound
      or upon the delicate and intellectual treatment of the musical interludes,
      suggesting familiar ideas, sentiments, or fancies, which exist in the
      minds of the speakers, though they are incapable of expression in speech.<a
      href="#linknote-210043" name="linknoteref-210043" id="linknoteref-210043">
      43 </a> These are certainly admirable points in their place, but they can
      scarcely serve as organising principles in a work of art; the melodrama
      must be content to take its place as a subordinate and connecting member
      if it is to have its true effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart never took up this opera again, and he was right. It could only
      have been rendered fit for the stage by complete reconstruction. The first
      act, however graceful the music may be, has too little variety in its
      treatment and tone to gain favour on the stage; the second is, as we have
      seen, barely tolerable. After the composition of the "EntfÃ¼hrung," "Zaide"
      was heard of no more, partly on account of the similarity of subject and
      accessories, partly because it was so far surpassed in every respect that
      it could not fail to fall henceforth into oblivion.<a

      CHAPTER XXII. "IDOMENEO."
    </h2>
    <p>
      ALTHOUGH in his earlier years Mozart's career had, as we have seen, been
      hindered by the circumstances <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p126.png">[126]</a></span> to which he
      was forced to succumb at Salzburg, yet the severe discipline to which he
      was subjected must have been in many respects useful during his period of
      education. Since his return from his travels, however, his Salzburg
      surroundings were utterly oppressive and distasteful to him. His time of
      training was over; what he now required was freedom, work worthy of his
      powers, and the means of producing all that he was able and willing to
      produce. But of all this Salzburg could give nothing, and want of
      appreciation and mistrust, in addition to external obstacles, almost
      caused Mozart to lose heart and spirit, and throw up his post. His longing
      looks were naturally turned in whatever direction deliverance might seem
      to lie, and he considered it a fortunate circumstance when he was
      commissioned to write the opera for the Carnival of 1781 at Munich. The
      interest he had excited in Karl Theodor and his consort rendered it
      comparatively easy for Mozart's friends among the court singers and
      musicians to direct the choice so that it should fall on him; the
      Archbishop had promised leave of absence too distinctly to be able to draw
      back, nor would his many obligations to the Bavarian court have rendered a
      refusal possible. An entirely new opera was desired on this occasion, and
      the Abbot Giambatt. Varesco, who had been court chaplain at Salzburg since
      1766, was commissioned to write the libretto; he could take counsel with
      Mozart, who knew the Munich company well, and by obeying his suggestions
      make the text quite according to his mind, so that a work not unworthy of
      the brilliant fame of the Munich Opera might be expected. When a
      translation of the text was called for later, Mozart proposed his old
      friend Schachtner, who was <span class="side">CHARACTERS AND PLOT.</span>

      employed to do it; and Leopold Mozart could write with some pride to
      Breitkopf (August 10,1781): "It is remarkable that every part of the work
      is by persons residing in Salzburg: the poetry by the court chaplain,
      Abbate Varesco, the music by my son, and the German translation by Herr
      Schachtner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Varesco's "Idomeneo" was modelled on the opera "IdomenÃ©e," written by
      Danchet and composed by Campra, first performed in 1712 and revived in
      1731.<a href="#linknote-22001" name="linknoteref-22001"

      The plot is briefly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Idomeneo, King of Crete, after the siege of Troy, has wandered a long way
      from his home, where his son, Idamante, grown to man's estate during his
      absence, awaits him in filial love. Electra, daughter of Agamemnon,
      banished by the people of Argus on account of the matricide of Orestes,
      has taken refuge with Idamante, and becomes deeply enamoured of him. But
      Ilia, daughter of Priam, who, with other Trojan captives, has been sent to
      Crete by Idomeneo, has conceived a passion for Idamante, which he returns.
      At the opening of the opera we find Ilia struggling with her love for the
      enemy of her fatherland (aria, 2). Idamante approaches her joyfully. He
      has received tidings that his father's fleet is in sight, and has sent his
      old confidant, Arbace, to bring more exact intelligence. On this joyful
      day he gives freedom to all the Trojan captives, and declares his love for
      Ilia, which she, although reluctantly, rejects; whereupon he bewails
      himself in an aria (3). The captive Trojans are led in and loosed from
      their fetters, <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p128.png">[128]</a></span> giving occasion for a joyful
      chorus. Electra comes and expresses dissatisfaction at the liberation of
      so many enemies. Then follows Arbace with intelligence (which is mistaken)
      of the shipwreck of Idomeneo. Idamante departs overwhelmed with grief.
      Electra remains behind and gives vent to her jealousy and despair in a
      song (aria, 5). The scene changes to the sea-coast, and the fleet of
      Idomeneo is seen threatened by a storm, and driven on to the rocks, the
      mariners lamenting and beseeching aid. Neptune appears and commands the
      winds to depart. Idomeneo prays for his help, but the god casts
      threatening glances on him, and disappears. The sea being calmed, Idomeneo
      lands and declares that, during the storm, he has vowed to sacrifice to
      Neptune the first person who shall meet him on shore. He trembles at the
      rashness of his vow, and anxiously looks for the sacrifice he is to make
      (aria, 6). Idamante enters, having sought solitude as ease to his grief.
      He offers shelter to the stranger, whom he fails to recognise. In the
      course of conversation it transpires that he is mourning for his father
      Idomeneo. Whereupon Idomeneo makes himself known, but overcome by the
      horror of his situation, he departs, forbidding Idamante to follow him.
      The latter, ignorant of the cause, is inconsolable at his father's
      rejection of his proffered love and services (aria, 8). An intermezzo of
      suitable character follows the first act. The warriors of Idomeneo
      disembark to a march (9), are welcomed by their wives and children, and
      "express their joy in a grand figure-dance, ending with a chorus (10)."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the second act Idomeneo is in conversation with
      Arbace. He communicates to him his fearful vow, from the fulfilment of
      which he wishes to escape. Arbace represents to him that this is
      impossible. But when he hears that Idamante is to be the sacrifice, he
      counsels his being sent to a distant country, and that during his
      banishment they should seek to appease the wrath of Neptune. Idomeneo
      decides upon commanding Idamante to accompany Electra to Argos, and there
      ascend the throne, and commissions Arbace to bid him prepare for the
      journey. Arbace promises obedience (aria, 11), and departs. Ilia now
      appears, expresses delight at Idomeneo's safety, and, while extolling
      Idamante's goodness, declares her own gratitude and submission (aria, 12).
      Her warmth causes Idomeneo to suspect their love, and his grief and
      confusion are thereby augmented (aria, 13). Electra, entering, thanks him
      for his care. He leaves her alone, and she expresses her joy at the
      fulfilment of her dearest wishes (aria, 14). The warriors assemble in the
      harbour to the sound of a march (15). Electra appears with her followers,
      the sea is calm, and all look forward to a fortunate voyage (chorus, 16).
      Idomeneo dismisses Idamante, who sees in this command a fresh proof of his
      father's inexplicable displeasure. They express their opposing sentiments
      in a terzet (17). As they prepare to embark, a terrific storm arises, and
      a huge sea-monster rises from the waves. This convinces Idomeneo that his
      <span class="side">IDOMENEO&mdash;PLOT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p129.png">[129]</a></span> disobedience has offended
      Neptune, and he determines to die himself, and not to sacrifice the
      innocent. "The storm continues to rage, the Cretans fly, and the act
      closes with the expression of their fear and horror by singing and
      pantomimic dancing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilia opens the third act, bewailing her unhappy love (aria, 19). Idamante
      surprises her, and declares his resolve to seek death in combat with the
      monster who is laying waste the land; this leads to a disclosure of her
      love, and the two express their happiness in a duet (20). Idomeneo,
      entering with Electra, discovers them; he cannot bring himself to
      acknowledge to Idamante the true cause of his mysterious behaviour, but
      commands him anew to leave Crete at once, and seek an asylum in a distant
      land. The various emotions of those present are expressed in a quartet
      (21). Idamante having departed, Arbace enters and announces that the
      people are hurrying with the high priest at their head to demand
      deliverance from the monster; Idomeneo goes to meet them, and Arbace
      expresses his earnest wish for the happiness of his ruler (aria, 22). On
      an open space in front of the castle the high priest appears with the
      multitude; he describes the ravages of the monster, which can only be
      terminated by the fulfilment of Idomeneo's vow, and demands to know the
      name of the promised victim (23). When Idomeneo names his son as the
      sacrifice, horror seizes the people (chorus, 24). During a march (25)
      Idomeneo with his subjects enters the temple of Neptune, and while the
      priests prepare for the sacrifice they offer their solemn prayers to the
      god (26); cries of joy are heard from afar, and Arbace hastens in and
      announces that Idamante has slain the monster in heroic combat. Idamante
      is presently borne in by priests and warriors, crowned and in white robes;
      he now knows his father's vow, and satisfied as to his feelings towards
      him, he is ready to fall a joyful sacrifice to the angry god (aria, 27).
      As Idomeneo is in the act of striking the fatal blow, Ilia hastens in and
      restrains him; she insists upon taking the place of her lover, and a
      tender strife arises between them, which Idomeneo listens to with emotion,
      Electra with rage and jealousy. As Ilia kneels before the altar, "a great
      subterranean disturbance is heard, the statue of Neptune totters, the high
      priest stands entranced before the altar, all are amazed and motionless
      from fear, while a deep and majestic voice declares the will of the gods":
      Idomeneo is to renounce the throne, which Idamante is to ascend, and to be
      united to Ilia (28). At this unexpected issue, Electra breaks into violent
      anger, and "goes off raging"; Idomeneo arranges everything according to
      the divine will (30), and expresses his grateful joy (aria, 31); Idamante
      is crowned in a pantomimic ballet, during which the chorus sing a joyful
      conclusion to the opera (32).<a href="#linknote-22002"

    <p>
      Varesco omitted the prologue of his original, and reduced the five acts to
      the customary three. He also left out altogether the divinities and
      allegorical personages, which were somewhat prominent in the French text;
      and of three confidants he retained only Arbace. For the rest he follows
      the progress of the plot pretty closely, only judiciously omitting the
      love of Idomeneo for Ilia, and altering the conclusion. In the original,
      Idomeneo, after voluntarily raising his son to the throne, and bestowing
      on him the hand of Ilia, is stricken with madness by Nemesis, and slays
      Idamante with the sacrificial axe. He is then prevented from committing
      suicide, but Ilia falls by her own hand. Metastasio had weaned Italian
      opera from such horrors. Varesco naturally looked to opera seria as the
      foundation of his adaptation,<a href="#linknote-22003"
      name="linknoteref-22003" id="linknoteref-22003"> 3 </a> but he endeavoured
      at the same time to make use of the distinctive features of French opera.
      This is evident in his care for variety of scenery and machinery, in the
      marches and processions which occur in every act, and in the pantomimic
      dances which are made subservient to the plot. Further, the frequent
      introduction of the chorus was evidently suggested by French opera, and a
      marked progress displayed in the fact that the chorus was not employed
      merely to heighten the pomp of the piece, but took part in the action at
      critical moments, and expressed important dramatic situations. The
      ensembles, too, are not placed in regular succession at the end of the
      acts, without reference to the plot; they occur naturally as the piece
      proceeds, and have a dramatic signification of their own. Such movements
      are indeed rarely introduced, and not all the suitable points are made use
      of for them; no attempt is made either to unite the several connected
      points of the plot into a musical whole in the finale, but rather each
      separate situation has its own independent musical treatment.<a
      href="#linknote-22004" name="linknoteref-22004" id="linknoteref-22004"> 4
      </a> On the other hand, there <span class="side">VARESCO'S LIBRETTO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p131.png">[131]</a></span> is an
      evident intention to give the piece a tragic tone rather than that of the
      then prevalent effeminate tenderness, and to invest the characters with a
      psychological interest, and the plot with natural development and climax.
      It must be admitted that the success is but partial. Varesco was no poet,
      and the spirit of French tragedy was not calculated to raise him to a
      higher sphere than that of Italian opera. Conventionality predominates,
      passion and emotion find but unnatural expression, pedantry and
      exaggeration, both alike untrue, jostle each other; and the plot hangs on
      such slender threads that, in spite of the strong passions which are set
      in motion, it awakens no lively interest. The weak points both of French
      and Italian opera are here combined; but there are other faults belonging
      more especially to the latter. Such, for example, is the giving of the
      part of Idamante to a male soprano, and employing the bass voice only for
      the subordinate part of the Oracle. Idomeneo is tenor, according to
      traditional usage, and stands almost alone against three soprano voices,
      for Arbaces as second tenor acts only as a stop-gap, and the high priest
      only appears once in an obbligato recitative. Generally speaking the airs
      do not form the culminating point of a dramatic situation, but only close
      it with a kind of point. Frequently they have only a commonplace phrase or
      an elaborated image for their subject, and all their individuality is
      bestowed upon them by the music. Varesco is nevertheless a practised
      verse-maker, who has employed, not without skill, the materials he found
      ready to hand, but is far removed from Metastasio's delicacy and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all its drawbacks the advantage of a settled tradition is very
      visible, the external arrangements, such as the distribution among the
      characters of the different pieces being carefully carried out. In short,
      if "Idomeneo" is compared with Mozart's earlier operas, the progress in
      the choice and treatment of material is very marked. Such an absolute
      blending of the essential features of French and Italian opera as is aimed
      at does not indeed take place; a compromise between the two had first to
      be made. It can scarcely be doubted that Mozart had a share in the
      construction of the libretto in its more important parts, and that <span
      class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p132.png">[132]</a></span> his experiences in Mannheim and
      Paris had qualified him for the task; but his influence was not felt in
      the details of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the libretto was ready, and part of the music composed, Mozart
      repaired to Munich, according to custom, to finish the opera on the spot.
      After a journey in the postcarriage, "which shook the soul out of one's
      body," and gave him not an instant's sleep, he wrote to his father
      (November 8, 1780), "Joyful and glad was my arrival!" There was plenty to
      be done: the opera was to be rehearsed, to be put on the stage, and the
      greater part of it was still unwritten. How much of it he took with him
      ready to Munich is not precisely known; probably the majority of the
      recitatives, the first act, and perhaps part of the second; at all events
      his first letters mention some of the songs as already composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was able to set to work with a good heart, for he was met with goodwill
      on all sides. Count Seeau was altogether at his service; and when they
      sometimes fell out, and Mozart was provoked to be rude, it was always the
      Count who gave way. The Elector received him very graciously. "I had
      almost forgotten the best!" he writes (November 15, 1780); "Count Seeau
      presented me <i>en passant</i> to the Elector last Sunday, after mass; he
      was very gracious, and said, 'I am glad to see you here again.' And when I
      said that I would endeavour to deserve the approbation of his highness, he
      patted me on the shoulder and said, 'Oh, I have no doubt it will all go
      very well indeed.' <i>A piano piano si va lontano!</i>" The nobility, too,
      were favourably disposed towards him. Cannabich introduced him to the
      Countess Baumgarten, who was then the favourite of the Elector. "My friend
      is everything in this house," he writes (November 13, 1780), "and I, too,
      now; it is the best and most useful house here for me, and so far all has
      gone, and by God's help will go, well with me." He was able, therefore, to
      satisfy his father as to the success of the opera (November 24, 1780):
      "Have no care as to my opera, dear father; I hope there will be no hitch.
      A little cabal is opposed to it, but it will certainly come to grief, for
      all the best and most powerful houses <span class="side">THE MUNICH
      SINGERS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p133.png">[133]</a></span>
      of the nobility are in my favour, as well as the principal musicians,
      especially Cannabich."<a href="#linknote-22005" name="linknoteref-22005"
      id="linknoteref-22005"> 5 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, at all events, no opposition to be feared on the part of the
      singers or the orchestra; they and Mozart were mutually anxious to satisfy
      each other. But their joint labours and the requirements of the stage
      showed many alterations in the text to be necessary, and Varesco must have
      been often appealed to to undertake these, or to sanction proposed
      changes. Among the performers for whom he wrote, Dal Prato gave him some
      real trouble. Soon after his arrival he had "a piece of roguery" to
      narrate (November 8, 1780): "I have not indeed the honour of knowing the
      heroic Dal Prato, but according to the description Ceccarelli must be
      better than he; for sometimes his breath fails in the middle of a song,
      and, <i>nota bene</i>, he was never on the stage, and Raaff is like a
      statue. Now, you may imagine the scene in the first act, the meeting of
      Idomeneo and Idamante." Further acquaintance with Dal Prato justified the
      reports concerning him. "My <i>molto amato Castrato dal Prato</i>," he
      writes (November 15,1780), "requires teaching the whole opera"; "he has to
      learn his part like a child, and has not a pennyworth of method" (November
      22, 1780). He was the stumbling block also in the quartet, which had to be
      rehearsed six times before it went right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fellow can do nothing," complains Mozart (December 30, 1780); "his
      voice would not be so bad if he did not sing in his throat and head, but
      he is absolutely without intonation or method or sentiment, and sings like
      the best among the boys who come to be heard when they seek admission to a
      choir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had trouble of quite another kind with his "dear old friend" Raaff. He
      was exceedingly fanciful, and Mozart made many alterations out of love for
      him and consideration for his gray hairs (December 27, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p134.png">[134]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me tell you that Raaff is the best and honestest man in the world, but
      so wedded to his old jog-trot ideas that it is enough to drive one crazy.
      Consequently it is very difficult to write for him; very easy, too, I
      grant you, if one is content to write songs such as, for example, the
      first, "Vedrommi intorno," &amp;c. If you could only hear it&mdash;it is
      good, and it is pretty; but if I had written it for Zonca I should have
      made it much better fitted to the words. I had a good deal of trouble with
      him about the quartet. The oftener I hear this quartet the more effective
      it appears to me, and every one that has heard it likes it. Only Raaff
      thinks it will be wanting in effect; he said to me, "Non c' Ã¨ da spianar
      la voce." As if there should not be more speaking than singing in a
      quartet! But he knows nothing about these things. I only said, "My dear
      friend! if there was only one note in this quartet that I thought should
      be altered, I would do it; but I am better satisfied with it than with any
      other piece in the opera, and when you have once heard it together, you
      will alter your mind. I have done my best to please you with your two
      songs, and so I will with the third, with good hopes of succeeding; but as
      far as regards the terzets and quartets, the composer should be allowed
      his own way." That satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the rehearsal Raaff "gladly acknowledged himself in the wrong, and
      had no more doubt as to the good effect of the quartet" (December 30,
      1780). When Mozart had "shown him the paces" of his first air, he was
      quite satisfied with it (November 15, 1780); and equally so with the air
      in the second act (December 1, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is as much in love with his song as a younger man might be with his
      fair lady: he sings it at night before he goes to sleep, and in the
      morning as soon as he wakes. He said to Baron Viereck and Herr von Castel,
      "I have always been used to have a hand in my own part, in the recitatives
      as well as the songs; but I have left this just as it was. There is not a
      note that does not suit me exactly." <i>Enfin</i>, he is as happy as a
      king over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ill-natured speeches were made in spite of all this, as Mozart writes
      to his father (December 27, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ã€ propos!</i> Becke tells me that he wrote to you again after the last
      rehearsal but one, and told you among other things that Raaffs song in the
      second act is not written for the words. "They tell me," he said, "that
      you know too little of Italian. Is it so?" "You should have asked me, and
      then written! I can assure you that he who told you this knows very little
      Italian himself." The song goes exceedingly well with the words. One hears
      the "mare" and the "mare funesto;" and the <span class="side">THE MUNICH
      SINGERS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p135.png">[135]</a></span>
      passages lead up to "minacciar" in a way that thoroughly expresses
      "minacciar"&mdash;a threatening; in fact, it is the finest song in the
      opera, and meets with universal approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two other male vocalists belonged to the old Munich opera. "Honest old
      Panzacchi" had been an excellent singer and a good actor in his time, but
      his best days were over; and Valesi, too, who had a well-deserved
      reputation as a tenor, had almost given up the stage, and devoted himself
      to teaching. L. Mozart had reason, therefore, to write (November 11,1780):
      "What you tell me of your vocalists is sad, and shows that everything must
      depend on the composition."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no difficulties this time with the female vocalists. Both the
      Wendlings were friendly and amenable&mdash;they went Mozart's way, and
      were contented with everything he did. "Madame Dorothea Wendling is <i>arci-contentissima</i>
      with her scena, and wanted to hear it three times over,', he wrote home
      (November 8,1780), and they were quite in accord about the second song.
      "Lisel Wendling," he wrote soon after (November 15, 1780), "sang her two
      songs half-a-dozen times; she is thoroughly pleased; I have it from a
      third person that both the Wendlings have praised their songs very
      highly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart kept up with great industry the work of rehearsing and composing (a
      song for Schikaneder was composed meanwhile, Vol. II., p. 102), although
      he was suffering from a severe cold. The homely remedies which his father
      ordered brought some alleviation of it, but, as he was obliged to continue
      writing, the cure was a slow one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Munich he fell in with Mara, who had not long left Berlin. "She is not
      so fortunate as to please me," he writes (November 13, 1780); "she does
      too little to come up to the Bastardina (Vol. I., p. 112), which is her
      ambition, and she does too much to touch the heart like a Weber, or an
      expressive singer." He was even less edified by the behaviour of the
      husband and wife than by Madame Mara's singing, and writes at a later date
      (November 24,1780) of the "pride, insolence, and effrontery which were
      visible in their countenances." When Mara was to sing at a court concert,
      after the first symphony "i saw her lord and master creep behind her with
      a violoncello in his hand; I thought it was going to be <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p136.png">[136]</a></span> a song
      with obbligato violoncello. Old Danzi, a very good accompanist, is first
      violoncellist here; all at once old Toeschi&mdash;conductor when Cannabich
      is not there&mdash;said to Danzi, who is his son-in-law, by the way,
      'Stand up, and let Mara take your place.' But Cannabich heard him, and
      cried, 'Danzi, stay where you are! The Elector likes his own people to
      play.' And the song proceeded. Herr Mara stood meekly with his violoncello
      in his hand behind his wife." The song which Mara was singing had a second
      part, but she went out during the ritornello without acquainting the
      orchestra, "with her native air of effrontery," and afterwards complained
      to the Elector.<a href="#linknote-22006" name="linknoteref-22006"
      id="linknoteref-22006"> 6 </a> He answered: "Madame, you sang like an
      angel, although your husband did not accompany you," and referred her to
      Count Seeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act was rehearsed at the end of November, and Mozart was able to
      report to his father such success as raised the general expectation to a
      still higher pitch (December 1, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rehearsal went off remarkably well. There were only six violins in
      all, but the proper wind instruments. No spectators were admitted but
      Seeau s sister and young Count Seinsheim. I cannot tell you how delighted
      and astonished every one was. It was only what I expected, for I assure
      you I went to this rehearsal with as light a heart as if it had been a
      banquet. Count Seinsheim said to me: "I assure you I expected much from
      you, but this I did not expect." The Cannabich family and all who know
      them are true friends of mine. I went home with Cannabich after the
      rehearsal. Madame Cannabich met us and embraced me, full of pleasure that
      the rehearsal had gone off so well; then came Ramm and Lang half out of
      their minds with delight. The good lady, my true friend, being alone in
      the house with her sick Rose, had been full of anxiety for me. Ramm said
      to me (if you knew him you would call him a true German, for he says to
      your face exactly what he thinks): "You may believe me when I say that no
      music ever made such an impression on me; and I thought fifty times what a
      pleasure it will be to your father to hear this opera." But enough of
      this! My cold was made rather worse by the rehearsal. One cannot help
      getting overheated when fame and honour are at stake, however cold-blooded
      one may naturally be.

    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfgang's father received other confirmation of the success, which he did
      not withhold from his son:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiala showed me a letter from Becke which is very eulogistic of the music
      of your first act. He writes that tears of joy and pleasure came to his
      eyes when he heard the music, and that every one declared it was the
      finest music they had ever heard&mdash;all so new and beautiful, &amp;c.
      He says that the second act is about to be rehearsed, that he will write
      to me himself, &amp;c. Well, God be thanked, this all looks well.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart, who had been wont to exhort Wolfgang not to procrastinate, as
      indeed he often did at Salzburg, was now concerned to hear of his
      obstinate cold, the more so as his sister was suffering from a chest
      complaint, and he begs him to take care of himself; he was not to hurry
      over the third act, it would be ready quite in good time. Ready, as he
      always was, with good advice, he warns him to remember that an opera
      should not only please connoisseurs (December 11, 1780): "I recommend you
      not to think in your work only of the musical public, but also of the
      unmusical. You know that there are a hundred ignorant people for every ten
      true connoisseurs, so do not forget what is called <i>popular</i>, and
      tickle the long ears." But Wolfgang will not listen to this. "As to what
      is called popular," he answers (December 16, 1780), "do not be afraid,
      there is music in my opera for all sorts of people&mdash;only none for
      long-ears." Meantime the work of rehearsing went steadily forward. On
      December 16, in the afternoon, the first and second acts were rehearsed at
      Count Seeau's, the parts being doubled, so that there were twelve violins.
      All went well, as Wolfgang reported (December 19, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra and all the audience gladly acknowledged that, contrary to
      their expectations, the second act was superior both in novelty and
      expression to the first. Next Saturday the second act is to be rehearsed
      again, but in a large room in the palace, which I have long desired, for
      the room at Count Seeau's is far too small. The Elector is to listen <i>incognito</i>
      in an adjoining apartment. "We must rehearse for dear life then," said
      Cannabich to me. At the last rehearsal he was bathed in perspiration. You
      will judge from my letters that I am well and hearty. It is a great thing
      to come to the end of a great and laborious work, and to feel that one
      leaves it with honour and fame; this I have almost done, for now nothing
      is wanting but three songs, and the last chorus of the third act, the
      overture and the ballet&mdash;"et adieu partie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p138.png">[138]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next rehearsal gave even greater satisfaction (December 27, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last rehearsal was splendid; it was in a large room in the palace, and
      the Elector was present. This time we had the whole orchestra (that
      belongs to the opera-house, of course). After the first act the Elector
      said "Bravo!" out loud; and when I went to pay my respects to him, he
      said, "This opera will be charming&mdash;it will certainly do you honour."
      As he was not sure of being able to remain to the end, we let him hear the
      concerted song, and the storm at the beginning of the second act. These he
      also approved of in the most kindly manner, and said, laughing, "No one
      would imagine that such great things could come out of such a little
      head." The other day at his early reception, too, he praised my opera very
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening at court the Elector again spoke in high praise of the
      music, and Mozart learnt from a sure source that he had said after the
      rehearsal, "I was quite taken by surprise&mdash;no music ever had such an
      effect on me&mdash;it is truly magnificent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this success reached Salzburg bit by bit. "All the town is
      talking of the excellence of your opera," his father tells him (December
      25, 1780). "Baron Lerbach set it going; the chancellor s wife told me that
      she had heard from him that the opera was wonderfully well spoken of
      everywhere. Then came Becke's letter to Fiala, which he gave to be read
      everywhere." Becke wrote to L. Mozart himself that "the storm chorus in
      the second act is so powerful that none could hear it, even in the
      greatest heat of summer, without turning as cold as ice;" and he praises
      Dorothea Wendling's concerted song very much. The violinist Esser from
      Mayence, who had given concerts in Salzburg, wrote from Augsburg
      concerning the two acts of the opera which he had heard: "Che abbia
      sentito una musica ottima e particolare, universalmente applaudita." "In
      short," writes the father, "it would be tedious to tell you all the
      compliments paid to you. I hope that the third act will have as good an
      effect, and I do so the more confidently, since all the best situations
      are here, and the subterranean voices must be startling and terrifying.<a
      href="#linknote-22007" name="linknoteref-22007" id="linknoteref-22007"> 7
      </a> I hope to be able to say, 'Finis coronat opus.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">REHEARSALS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p139.png">[139]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      To this his son answers, over head and ears in work (December 30, 1780):
      "The third act will be thought <i>at least</i> as good as the other two: I
      like it infinitely better, and you may justly say, 'Finis coronat opus.'"
      But there was plenty to do meantime. "Head and hands," he writes (January
      3,1781), "are full of the third act, so that I should not be surprised if
      I were to turn into a third act myself; It alone has cost me more trouble
      than the whole opera, for there is not a scene in it that has not peculiar
      interest." He had the satisfaction of finding after the rehearsal that it
      really was considered to surpass the other two acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's anxious father strove to draw his attention to every point that
      might contribute to success, and particularly cautioned him to keep on
      good terms with the orchestra (December 25, 1780). Experience of Salzburg
      must necessarily have shown him the importance of this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to keep your orchestra in good humour&mdash;flatter them, and make
      them devoted to you by praising them; I know your way of writing, and the
      unceasing and close attention it exacts from all the instruments; it is no
      joke for the orchestra to be kept on the stretch of their attention for
      three hours and more. Every one, even the worst fiddler, is touched by
      being praised <i>tÃªte-Ã¤-tÃªte</i>, and becomes more and more attentive and
      zealous; and these courtesies cost you nothing but a few words. But you
      know it all yourself; I only tell you because such things are often
      forgotten at rehearsal, and you will need the friendship and zeal of the
      whole orchestra when the opera is in scena. The position is then altered,
      and the player's attention must be much more intent. You know that they
      cannot all be friendly towards you. There is always a <i>but</i> and an <i>if</i>
      to be met with. You say people doubted whether the second act would come
      up to the first. This doubt being relieved, few will have misgivings for
      the third act. But I will wager my head that there will be some who will
      doubt whether the music will be as effective in the theatre as in a room;
      and in that case the greatest zeal and goodwill are necessary on the part
      of the orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the opera was not ready yet; there was to be no ballet, only a
      divertissement fitting into the plot, and this Mozart was, as he expressed
      it, to have the honour of composing (December 30, 1780). "I am very glad
      of it," he adds, "for then the music will be by <i>one</i> master." He was
      <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p140.png">[140]</a></span> hard at work at the "cursed
      dances" until the middle of January, and had no time to think of anything
      else, not even of his own health. It was not until January 18 that he
      could write: Laus Deo, at last I have come to an end of it!" Amid
      rehearsals and anxious labours, the day of representation drew near. L.
      Mozart had been concerned lest the death of the Empress Maria Theresa on
      November 29, 1780, should put a stop to it, but Wolfgang reassured him by
      saying that none of the theatres had been closed on this account. Soon
      after he was terrified by a rumour that the Electress was dangerously ill,
      but discovered this to be a "lie from beginning to end." At first January
      20, 1781, was fixed for the performance, then the 22nd, and finally
      January 29; the last rehearsal was to be on the 27th, Wolfgang's birthday;
      he was pleased at the postponements: "The opera can be oftener and more
      carefully rehearsed." The fame of "Idomeneo," which had reached Salzburg
      even before its performance, was a great source of satisfaction to
      Mozart's friends; Dr. Prexl, for instance (Vol. II., p. 84), wrote to him
      of the "inexpressible satisfaction" with which he had learnt the honour
      done by Wolfgang to Salzburg, and more than one friend undertook the
      journey to Munich in order to be present; among these were Frau Robini and
      her family, two FrÃ¤ulein Barisani, and Fiala, from the Kapelle. L. Mozart,
      who was "as pleased as a child about the excellence of the orchestra,"
      intended to go to Munich with his daughter as soon as he could arrange to
      be absent. But as he dared not risk a refusal from the Archbishop, and it
      was rumoured that the latter meditated a journey to Vienna, he waited his
      time. It suited him very well that the first performance was postponed
      until Hieronymus had actually left Salzburg. This being so, he set out on
      January 26 to be present at the last rehearsal and the performance.
      Wolfgang had arranged that his father and sister should find accommodation
      at his own lodging (in the Burggasse), if they would be contented to live
      for the time "like gipsies or soldiers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of Mozart's father and sister at Munich brings us to a
      detailed account of the performance of "Idomeneo" <span class="side">PERFORMANCE,
      JANUARY 29, 1781.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p141.png">[141]</a></span>
      and its success. The "Munich Literary and Miscellaneous News" (February 1,
      1781, No. XIX., p. 76) announced it briefly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th ult. the opera of "Idomeneo" was performed for the first time
      in the new opera-house. The adaptation, music, and translation all proceed
      from Salzburg. The scenery, including a view of the harbour and Neptune's
      temple, are among the masterpieces of our well-known theatrical architect,
      the Herr Councillor Lorenz Quaglio.<a href="#linknote-22008"
      name="linknoteref-22008" id="linknoteref-22008"> 8 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      All that we read, however, of the success of the opera in rehearsal leaves
      us no doubt that it met with a very favourable reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the sum received by Mozart in payment for "Idomeneo" we know
      nothing; but it cannot have been a large one, or L. Mozart would not have
      written (December 11, 1780): "How about the score? will it not be copied?
      You must be careful as to this, for <i>with such a payment the score
      cannot be given up</i>." To which Wolfgang answered (December 16, 1780):
      "I made no ceremony as to the copying of the score, but spoke openly on
      the subject to the Count. It was always the custom in Mannheim (where the
      kapellmeister was well paid besides) to give up the score to the
      composer." The original score, in three volumes, is written in a very neat
      but rapid hand, with scarcely any alterations except a few in the
      recitatives. As usual, the different numbers are written separately and
      then put together; the double-bass part was written larger, as in other
      scores, for the convenience of the bass-player at the clavier. The score
      was to have been printed at the time, as appears from a letter of L.
      Mozart to Breitkopf (August 10, 1781): "We were advised to publish the
      opera, printed or engraved, either in full score or clavier score.
      Subscribers were promised for some thirty copies, among whom was his
      highness Prince Max of ZweibrÃ¼cken, but my son's journey to Vienna and the
      intervening events caused us to postpone the whole affair." The music for
      the ballet which was given with "Idomeneo" has not yet been printed (367
      K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart seems to have set great value on "Idomeneo" <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p142.png">[142]</a></span> (366
      K.), even in later years;<a href="#linknote-22009" name="linknoteref-22009"
      id="linknoteref-22009"> 9 </a> it is certain that soon after he had made
      good his footing in Vienna he exerted himself to have it placed on the
      stage, for which purpose he intended entirely to remodel it. Unfortunately
      this project fell through, and when in 1786 a company of distinguished
      amateurs performed the opera at the residence of Prince Karl Auersperg,
      Mozart contented himself with several alterations, but did not attempt a
      complete remodelling. Later, and more especially quite recently,
      "Idomeneo" has been given from time to time on different stages, without
      exciting as much interest in the general public as the better-known works
      of Mozart; the judgment of connoisseurs, on the other hand, has always
      distinguished it.<a href="#linknote-220010" name="linknoteref-220010"
      id="linknoteref-220010"> 10 </a> Both phenomena are comprehensible on a
      close examination of the distinctive features of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulibicheff remarks with great justice that it is easy to distinguish in
      "Idomeneo" where Mozart has still clung to the formulas of the opera
      seria, where he strives to imitate Gluck and the French opera, and where
      he gives free play to his own independent impulses as an artist. These
      indications are, of course, not to be met with accurately marked out in
      the different pieces, Mozart's individuality, in the perfection to which
      it had now attained, being throughout the very pith of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that the libretto unites the characteristics of Italian and
      French opera as far as style is concerned, but that the determining
      element is the Italian style. We have seen further that the singers, with
      the exception of the two female characters, belonged to the Italian
      school, which fact tended to the maintenance of Italian form.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might therefore be expected that Mozart, especially in the songs,
      should set out from the traditional forms, and only <span class="side">ITALIAN
      CHARACTER OF THE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p143.png">[143]</a></span> attempt to modify them as far as
      was possible. But the influence of the French original on the opera lay
      deeper than this, and was impressed on its poetry, language, and
      nationality, Italian as these all were in external form. Let us consider
      the songs. The effort is evident to give a more individual expression to
      the sentiment arising from the dramatic situation than was usual even with
      Metastasio; but the form and construction are only modified, and have
      retained the specific character of Italian poetry. The rhetoric differs
      altogether from the rhetoric of French poetry. Indirectly, too, language
      by its rhythm and accent affects musical construction, and the
      distinctions between the Italian and French language are strikingly
      apparent, not only in the recitatives, which are governed by the musical
      character of the language, but in the formation of the melodies, where
      language must be taken into account as an essential element. But deepest
      of all lies the difference in the conceptions and ideas of the two
      nations. The emotions and passions of different nations vary not only in
      intensity but in mode of expression, and where a truly national art has
      developed itself this special character is stamped on all its productions.
      The Italians express their feelings vividly and accent them strongly, and
      not only so, but their instinctive love of formula calls forth sharply
      defined characterisation and favours typical developments, as is shown,
      for instance, in their singularly perfect talent for pantomimic
      representations. This tendency has had a marked influence on the
      development of music, particularly of dramatic music, in Italy. It still
      bears a national character, which is not only stamped on it in certain
      forms and turns of expression, but which is the artistic expression of
      emotions springing from the very nature of the people. Whoever has heard
      Italian music performed both by Italian and German singers will readily be
      convinced that the difference rests not only on style and method, but
      still more essentially on the peculiarities of the Italian national
      character. It should not therefore be matter for surprise that music which
      to Germans appears false or unnatural should make a much deeper impression
      on Italians than the merely sensual one which strikes the ear.

    <p>
      <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's "Idomeneo" bears this distinctive Italian colouring, as do all
      his Italian operas, not only in the employment of Italian technicalities
      and mechanism, but in the living breath and fragrance which nothing but an
      absorption into the national spirit could bestow. Even as a boy he
      displayed a delicate sense of national distinctions, when in "Bastien und
      Baitienne" and the "Finta Semplice" he defined so sharply the limits of
      German vaudeville and of opera buffa. If "Zaide" is compared with
      "Idomeneo," the fundamental distinctions of conception and style are not
      less definitely marked; and the same was the case later in the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung" and the "Zauberflote," in "Figaro," "Don Giovanni," "Cosi fan
      Tutte," and "Tito." To give only one example: one of the most beautiful
      and affecting scenes that Mozart ever wrote is that in which Idomeneo, at
      the request of the high priest, indicates his son as the sacrifice
      demanded by the gods, and all the people break out into lamentations; and
      yet this chorus (24) is a most unmistakable instance of the Italian form
      and style. Places like "GiÃ¤ rÃ©gna la morte" appear typical of similar
      modes of expression which occur so frequently in Italian operas. But the
      Italian mould in which Mozart's work is cast, and on which the harmony of
      the whole depends, is not consciously put forward as a national colouring.
      It proceeds from such an intimate acquaintance with the Italian style as
      was then considered the proper foundation for musical studies, and was
      only possible so long as Italian music bore actual sway in German churches
      and theatres, and found no contradiction in the national consciousness.
      This sway was undisputed in South Germany during Mozart's youth and period
      of artistic development. The musical atmosphere in which he grew up, the
      elements of culture which were offered to him, were thoroughly Italian;
      and Italian conceptions and fashions had become second nature to him as to
      all other German artists who took part in the development of Italian opera
      during the last century. The relation in which an artistic genius stands
      to his time and nation is difficult to grasp. Far from shunning the
      influences of either, his genius displays itself in his power of
      representing their significant <span class="side">MOZART'S USE OF ITALIAN
      FORMS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p145.png">[145]</a></span>
      features and tendencies with force and vigour, amounting even to
      one-sidedness; and then again it sets itself in opposition to them, and
      struggles until it rules and determines them anew. It would be a hard task
      indeed to fathom the nature of an artist to that point where the threads
      of his personal powers and proclivities, and those of the cultivation of
      his time and nation, are so interwoven that they appear as the root of his
      artistic individuality; we must be content with tracing onward the path of
      his development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mozart's training had so imbued him with the spirit of Italian
      music that its essence appeared to him as the essence of music itself, yet
      he transformed the elements which he had so absorbed with the whole force
      of his individuality. He did not consciously adopt them as national,
      neither did he oppose them from motives of patriotism, and seek to
      substitute a German style. His individuality joined issue with the
      elements of an art ready to hand in full development, and produced works
      of art which were genuinely Italian, and also genuinely Mozart. The fresh
      new life which had awakened in German poetry, and which first caused a
      consciousness of national existence to show itself in the realm of art,
      touched Mozart at a time when his musical education was already firmly
      grounded. He could therefore without self-contradiction continue along the
      trodden path, and carry on the development of the Italian opera as a
      settled form of art, which he had made his own in the truest sense. But
      the impulse of German art laid hold, as we shall see, of his innermost
      being, and gave him clear consciousness of his capabilities as a German
      artist. Granted that the German element of his nature&mdash;with which he
      could never dispense&mdash;remained latent and inactive while he
      appropriated Italian art as his own, yet all that he so took was treated
      as his own free property and turned to account with German thought and
      feeling. While thus the German school of music was partly founded, partly
      endued with new life by him, he brought Italian opera to a climax as far
      as its universal application was concerned; after Mozart it becomes more
      exclusively national. Like every genius who has made his mark in the
      history of art, he casts his <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p146.png">[146]</a></span> glance over
      the past as well as into the future. To him it was given to concentrate
      the living elements of Italian music into works of mature perfection in
      art, and, setting to work with freshly tempered force, to turn to account
      the youthful impulses of German music, and lead them towards the goal of
      artistic freedom and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in Idomeneo we recognise the genuinely Italian character of the
      opera seria, brought to its highest perfection by the force of Mozart's
      perfectly cultivated individuality; but in details we still perceive the
      ascendency of traditional form, to which the artist was obliged to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is most unmistakably present in the two songs allotted to Arbace. The
      part of confidant was intended both musically and dramatically as a
      stop-gap; it served as a foil for the more important characters, and was a
      principal adjunct in the production of that <i>chiaroscuro</i> which was
      considered as essential to scenic effect. On this account Arbace's two
      songs (11, 22) are not woven into the dramatic web of the opera either in
      words or music. Some concessions were doubtless made to Panzacchi, a
      clever and accomplished singer of the old school, and there is no lack of
      runs, jumps, and similar feats for display of execution. The songs follow
      the old fashion in other ways also (except that they have only one tempo,
      and a structure modified accordingly), as, for instance, in the
      introduction of cadenzas; a very long ritornello of the second song is
      afterwards shortened at both ends. But in order to give them some musical
      interest, the accompaniment, although weak in instrumentation, is
      carefully worked out in counterpoint, especially in the second song. The
      preceding accompanied recitative, in composing which Mozart plainly had
      Panzacchi in view, is fine and expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dal Prato also, for whom the part of Idamante was intended, had only the
      knowledge of an Italian singer, and that in no considerable degree. Mozart
      was again, therefore, fettered by tradition, and could venture little to
      render the song more original and lifelike. In all the three songs for
      this character (3, 8, 27), the old type is clearly to be recognised. The
      first, if the singer had had a powerful execution, <span class="side">MUSIC
      FOR DAL PRATO AND RAAFF.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p147.png">[147]</a></span> which he avowedly had not, would
      probably have been an ordinary bravura song; it has the general plan of
      one, but is without bravura passages. The emphasis is laid on the
      accompaniment, which is independent and interesting throughout; the
      constant use of the wind instruments supplies it with fine sound effects.
      The frequent changes of time, the construction of the song being in all
      other respects very regular, is intended to give animation to the
      expression. The second air is shorter, to suit the situation, more lively
      and energetic in expression, but equally dependent on the accompaniment
      for originality and interest. The third adheres to the old form by the
      introduction of a slow middle movement (Larghetto 3-4) and the
      accompaniment is simpler; but the song as a whole is conciser than was the
      fashion formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raaff's advanced age would have prevented his satisfying any very great
      expectations; but he was also, as Mozart complained, "so wedded to his old
      jog-trot ideas that it was enough to drive one crazy." He was obliged
      therefore in the very important part of Idomeneo to submit to much that
      was against his convictions and inclinations. But Raaff was an
      accomplished and sensible singer, from whom much could be looked for in
      respect of delivery and expression. His first air (6) vividly expresses
      deep and painful feeling in two tolerably short and precise movements, an
      andantino sostenuto 3-4, and allegro di molto (5); it is dramatically
      quite in its place, and gives opportunity to the singer to display a
      well-trained voice. The detached, sharply defined motifs, united by
      interludes, remind us of the old style, but they are very cleverly
      arranged and carried out, and the treatment of the wind instruments gives
      a splendidly sonorous and yet subdued effect to the orchestra, which was
      then quite novel, and must have been remarkably impressive. The second air
      (13) is a long bravura song in one movement (allegro maestoso) in the
      grand style. Mozart calls it "the most splendid song" of the opera; and
      protests vigorously against the idea that it was not written "for the
      words"; but more was demanded from the singer than Raaff was able to give.
      It has the proper heroic character of the opera seria, and affords
      opportunity for the display of vocal art in <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p148.png">[148]</a></span>
      sustained passages, long notes, and bravura passages. The last are
      completely obsolete; but Mozart was right to think well of the song; it is
      full of expression and character, interesting through its rich and
      brilliant accompaniment, and containing, especially in the middle
      movement, surprising beauties of harmony. How striking and expressive is,
      for instance, this harmonic transition:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The third air (30), which Mozart endeavoured to write to please his old
      friend, is on that very account quite after the old pattern; it has great
      resemblance to the song which Mozart had so accurately fitted to Raaff at
      Mannheim (p. 408). The chief movement is a broadly sustained adagio,
      simple and noble in tone, and giving opportunity to the singer to display
      sustained singing, the effect of which is enhanced by a figured
      accompaniment, shared between the strings and the wind instruments; the
      middle movement, allegretto 3-8, is of less importance. A sketch which has
      been preserved of this song affords a good example of Mozart's method of
      work; the ritornellos, the voice and the bass are <span class="side">ILIA&mdash;ELECTRA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p149.png">[149]</a></span> all
      fully noted. Probably he submitted the sketch to Raaff before elaborating
      the song; it coincides in all but a few unimportant alterations with the
      later elaboration. He wished at first to compose the words of the middle
      movement in the same time and measure as the first movement; after four
      bars, however, which he erased, he wrote the middle movement as it at
      present stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the restrictions laid upon him in this far from inconsiderable
      part of the opera, Mozart's progress since the "Re Pastore" is very
      marked. What we now find is not the struggle of youthful genius against
      obsolete and hampering forms, but a conscious compliance with them, on
      definite grounds, by means of which the composer strives to extract all
      the good possible from his unfavourable circumstances, and knows exactly
      how far he can go. It is difficult, however, now that the tradition of
      these forms is wholly lost, to decide with certainty how much is due to
      the insensible effect of custom, and how much to the conscious labour of
      the artist. Those pieces in which Mozart could act without control make an
      entirely different impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these belong the parts of Ilia and Electra. Bravura has a decided place
      in the conception of the latter, but with an individual colouring of
      passion which Mozart has made free use of as the characterising element.
      The two great airs (5, 29) are the vivid expression of a glowing impulsive
      nature, which is raised by an admixture of haughty dignity above that
      vulgarity into which violent outbreaks of jealousy and revenge so readily
      fall. In spite of the text, which puts the traditional bombastic pathos
      into the mouth of Electra (29)&mdash;

</pre>
    <p>
      the composer has succeeded in infusing character and individuality into
      the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two songs are allied in subject, but their treatment is <span
      class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p150.png">[150]</a></span> different. While in the first
      passion ferments, as it were, and breaks forth in separate bursts, the
      second is a continuous stream of wild rage, and calls for the more
      particular employment of the higher notes of the voice. Purely executive
      display is not sought after, with the exception of one passage going up to
      C in alt, and very expressive, if well sung, but a passionate,
      well-declaimed delivery is taken for granted throughout. Occasionally the
      voice part is more declamatory than melodious, and the effect is provided
      for by a rapid succession of striking harmonies. How wonderfully
      affecting, for instance, is the passionate outcry:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra has an altogether novel function as a means of musical
      characterisation. It goes its independent way <span class="side">ELECTRA&mdash;ILIA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p151.png">[151]</a></span> side by
      side with the voice, interesting by virtue of the singular vitality of its
      accompanying passages and its own motifs, and its masterly tone-colouring
      gives body and force to the whole composition. In the first air all is
      restless motion&mdash;we have the flutes in broken chords, flashes of
      sound like lightning from the wind instruments, and only at certain points
      are the forces united into a concentrated expression of emotion. How
      striking, again, is the effect in the last song when, after the long
      torturing shake passage for the violins,<a href="#linknote-220011"
      name="linknoteref-220011" id="linknoteref-220011"> 11 </a> the united
      orchestra bursts forth into a very transport of revengeful feeling.<a
      href="#linknote-220012" name="linknoteref-220012" id="linknoteref-220012">
      12 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Electra's middle song (14) is in strong contrast to the passionate
      outbursts of the other two; here her happy love seems to fill her very
      being. She breathes forth a calm serenity and tender sweetness, as if
      there could be no place in her heart for jealousy and revenge. The voice
      part with the exception of one ornamental passage resembling the string
      quartet accompaniment, is very simple; rightly delivered the expression of
      satisfied affection will be found quite in accord with Electra's
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the character of Ilia, Mozart has followed his natural bent; it is full
      of sentiment, tender and graceful, without any violent passion. It was
      played by the excellent actress and singer, Dorothea Wendling; here Mozart
      had free scope, and in her songs (2, 12, 19) we find the finest expression
      of his manner as an artist. In the first air (2) we find the simplest
      means lying ready to hand employed to give dramatic effect; such, for
      instance, is the alternation of major and minor key for the principal
      subject, the climax produced by its repetition, the different ways in
      which the exclamation "Grecia!" is treated, &amp;c. Not only are we
      affected by the charm of beautiful and graceful ideas, but the expedients
      of formal construction become the natural <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p152.png">[152]</a></span>
      expression of the innermost feelings of the heart. The second air (12) is
      a cavatina, having two verses repeated with trifling alterations, and
      accompanied by four obbligato wind instruments, viz.: flute, oboe, horn,
      and bassoon, Besides the string quartet. Mozart's old Mannheim friends,
      wendling, Ramm, Lang, and Ritter were together again, and he was delighted
      to write a piece that should do honour to them and to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no question as to his success. The first impression is one of
      the purest melody, filling the musical listener with perfect satisfaction.
      A nearer examination shows as much to admire in the simplicity of the
      artistic structure (the symmetry of which in reading the score is
      displayed as it were on a ground plan) and in the delicate use of sound
      effects, as in the tenderness and grace of the conception. Let us consider
      the situation. Ilia comes to thank Idomeneo for the kindness which she, as
      a captive, has received in Crete. She is embarrassed by the remembrance
      that she has lost her father and her fatherland, that Idomeneo is her
      ruler, and the father of Idamante, and, more than all, by the
      consciousness of her love for Idamante; and yet this very love sheds for
      her a rosy light on all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      She begins, then, with a composed, almost reverential address, and as her
      feelings grow more intense, the remembrance of her sorrows returns; but
      all gives way to the one feeling: "or gioja e contento," in which she
      altogether loses herself. Such a combination of different elements into a
      harmonious whole constitutes a true work of art, and it must needs be
      found beautiful as long as the principles of music remain what they are.
      The situation of the last air (19) is less striking; it is the longing
      sigh of a deserted lover; but the main features of Ilia's character have
      already been so clearly defined that her singular charm is as indelibly
      impressed here as elsewhere. It is only necessary to compare the air (14),
      in which Electra expresses her tenderest feelings, to perceive how the
      essential distinctions between the two women are characterised by the
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duet for the two lovers (20 b) is interesting and pleasing, but not
      very striking; in form and change of tempo, <span class="side">ENSEMBLES.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p153.png">[153]</a></span> as well
      as in conception and treatment, it adheres to the old-established custom
      of making a love duet light and graceful. It proceeds in unbroken movement
      and precise form throughout, and there is no true bravura.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terzet (17) is more striking, noble, and simple, and of fine musical
      effect, but the dramatic situation is not brought to expression in the
      full energy of which it is capable. It is certainly placed with design
      between a succession of pleasing situations and of more agitated ones; its
      calm and earnest mood fitly concludes what has gone before and prepares
      the mind for what is to follow, without unduly diminishing the effect of
      surprise. In the situation, as here presented, the three characters are
      all in a depressed and anxious mood, which restrains any lively outburst
      of emotion, and justifies the moderation of the musical rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quartet (21) takes a higher place as regards invention and
      characterisation; Mozart himself preferred it, and rejected any
      interference from the singers in its composition as decidedly as he gave
      way to them in the songs. It is not an easy task to write a quartet for
      three sopranos and a tenor, but Mozart's accurate knowledge of the
      capabilities of the voices, and his skilful combinations, enabled him to
      command the most original and beautiful sound effects. We must admire,
      too, his genius in marking out a distinct plan, within the limits of which
      he moves at his ease, and in giving sharp touches of character without
      disturbing the unity of the piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilia and Idamante stand in natural contrast to Idomeneo and Electra, and
      each individual is accurately characterised. This is most apparent where
      they all sing together, and gives life and significance to the music.
      Besides the independent treatment of the voices, the quartet is especially
      distinguished by harmonic beauties of an uncommon kind, and undeniably
      belongs to Mozart's finest performances. His wife relates that once, when
      singing in this quartet, he was so deeply affected that he was obliged to
      desist, and for a long time would not look at the composition again.<a
      href="#linknote-220013" name="linknoteref-220013" id="linknoteref-220013">
      13 </a> The <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p154.png">[154]</a></span> conclusion is original and
      appropriate. Idamante's commencement is that of a man who has made up his
      mind: "AndrÃ© ramingo e solo," however, dies away with the words "morte
      cercando" into gloomy meditations. At the close he again announces, "AndrÃ²
      ramingo e solo," and leaves the scene while the orchestra continues to
      express gloom and sadness, dying away gradually into silence.<a
      href="#linknote-220014" name="linknoteref-220014" id="linknoteref-220014">
      14 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus forms a principal feature of "Idomeneo." There is an important
      difference, however, between those choruses which actually belong to the
      plot and express the meaning of the situation with emphasis, and those
      which are only superficially connected with the plot, and serve
      principally for ornament. These last are mostly in connection with the
      ballet, and should be placed side by side with the ballet music. Such are
      the first chorus (4), during which the Trojan captives are loosed from
      their fetters, the closing chorus during Idamante's coronation, and most
      especially the chorus at the end of the first act (10), in which we should
      not fail to recognise dance music, even without the superscription
      "Ciaconna" and the express indication of the libretto. The orchestra has a
      more independent part here than in the two other choruses. The character
      of them all is fresh and cheerful; as with a man rejoicing in the fulness
      of his health and strength, everything is stirring and full of sound and
      bustle, so it is with these choruses, which, without any striking
      qualities, are thoroughly effective where they stand. The charming chorus
      previous to the embarkation of Electra and Idamante is more
      characteristic, and seems to mirror the cheerful heavens and the calm sea,
      together with Electra's happy frame of mind. Very happy in expression are
      the verses which Electra sings between the choruses&mdash;simple, clear,
      and full of grace and delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">CHORUSES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p155.png">[155]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the remaining choruses, which are more properly dramatic, are
      incomparably more important, grand, and earnest. The first (5),
      representing the shipwreck of "Idomeneo," is a double chorus for male
      voices. One chorus in the distance is in four parts&mdash;the other,
      nearer, is in two parts; the former is mostly in unison, the latter
      imitative; each chorus is complete in itself, and quite independent of the
      other, but the two together form an artistic, clearly apprehended whole.
      The orchestra contrasts with it as a solid mass, the stringed instruments
      belonging more especially to the second, and the wind instruments to the
      first chorus. It falls to the orchestra to depict the storm, and there are
      plenty of chromatic scales for the purpose, but the effect depends chiefly
      on bold and forcible harmonies. How little Mozart shunned difficulties and
      obstacles may be proved by several parts of this scene, the following
      passage among others:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more powerful are the choruses which close the second act. Again
      there arises a storm, the sea-monster appears, and horror seizes the
      people. While the orchestra is in constant agitation, the chorus
      interposes <i>en masse</i>, partly in full chords, partly in effective
      unison. The succession of striking harmonies reaches its height in the
      four-times repeated <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p156.png">[156]</a></span> question "il
      reo quai Ã¨?" which closes with a pause on a dissonant chord, repeated,
      like an echo, by all the wind instruments. Such a magnificent and
      agitating effect as is attained by this concentration into one point of
      every musical expedient, without overstepping the boundaries of the
      beautiful, had scarcely been heard in any opera, and Mozart himself never
      surpassed it. The concluding chorus, which follows an accompanied
      recitative for Idomeneo, is of an entirely different character, expressive
      of a flight, winged by fear and horror. The 12-8 time, seldom used by
      Mozart, is suited to the expression of haste and agitation, and so also is
      the generally independent and partially imitative treatment of the voices.
      They only unite sometimes into an outcry of horror, otherwise they make
      detached exclamations, and each goes his way in hurried confusion until
      all are dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus in the third act (24) expresses a totally different sentiment
      in equally grand style. When, after the effective appeal of the High
      Priest, Idomeneo discloses his obligation to sacrifice his son, the
      people, still discontented and murmuring, are struck with grief and
      horror. The intensity and almost over-wealth of beauty with which these
      emotions are expressed give the music, as we have already remarked, the
      national stamp of the Italian opera. We may learn from this chorus how in
      a true work of art the universal emotions of the human heart may be
      blended with the peculiarities of national and individual life and
      transported into the realm of pure art. The effect of unison at the words
      "giÃ¤ rÃ©gna la morte," expressing the depressed murmur of the people, is
      wonderfully fine; the chromatic triplet passage of the accompaniment seeks
      meanwhile in vain to raise the fainting spirits higher. This motif passes
      finely into the calm confidence of the High Priest's prayer, and the
      touchingly beautiful orchestral conclusion lets a ray of light on to this
      dispirited mood. But the climax has not yet reached its highest point.
      After a simple but wonderfully effective march, there follows a prayer for
      Idomeneo and the Priest which is a complete masterpiece, whether we
      consider its truthful expression of emotion, its rich and original
      orchestral accompaniment, or the combination in it of the various elements
      which produce the <span class="side">CHORUSES&mdash;RECITATIVE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p157.png">[157]</a></span> total
      effect. We can here merely indicate the short chorus of priests, which
      remains in unison in the one key of C, while the instruments (the strings
      <i>pizzicato</i> in a harplike movement, the wind instruments in
      characteristic passages) proceed in varied harmonies from C minor to F
      major, whereupon the voices sink to F and keep this key, while the
      orchestra gives out the solemn and quieting chords of the so-called church
      ending (B minor, F major).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much to be regretted that after this chorus the opera follows the
      usual course of opera seria, and leaves important dramatic situations
      unused for the purposes of musical representation. If, according to the
      original design, the remaining chief situations had been wrought together
      into a duet for Ilia and Idamante and a quartet, we should then possess
      masterpieces of grand dramatic music at the close of the opera; instead of
      this separate songs have been detached from their context in order to
      satisfy the singers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandiose and free treatment of the choruses, both in the voice parts
      and the accompaniments, places them almost on a level with those of "KÃ¶nig
      Thamos"; but a more condensed and pregnant style of music was required in
      the opera than in "KÃ¶nig Thamos," where the connection with the drama was
      loose and superficial. Mindful of this consideration, Mozart, while giving
      the choruses free scope for musical execution, never allows them to stand
      independent of and apart from the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reminiscence of French opera is evident in the treatment of the
      recitatives as well as in the important part allotted to the chorus. The
      groundwork of the dialogue is, as usual, in secco recitative, but
      accompanied recitative is more often employed as introductory to the songs
      than formerly, and it is also made use of as the most fitting vehicle for
      passionate or agitated soliloquies, such as that of Idomeneo after the
      appearance of the monster (18), or for solemn and pathetic appeals, such
      as that of the High Priest (22); also at different points of the dialogue
      where the sentiment rises above the tone of ordinary speech, the
      accompanied recitative interrupts the secco for a longer or shorter
      interval, and gives the dialogue increased power and <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p158.png">[158]</a></span>
      animation. The treatment of this kind of recitative is always free. It
      passes from sharply accented declamation into more or less elaborate
      melodious song. In the same way the orchestra sometimes serves simply as
      supporting accompaniment, sometimes suggests in an interlude or carries
      out more fully the expression of feeling excited by the words. A truly
      inexhaustible wealth of striking and, from many points of view,
      interesting features and beautiful motifs displays itself in these
      recitatives. Very fine, for instance, is the anticipation in Electra's
      recitative (p. 171, score) of the principal subject of the following song.
      How suggestive it is when Idomeneo, Ilia having just left him, expresses
      the conviction that she loves Idamante, in the characteristic motif of her
      song, by which doubtless she has betrayed her love, weaving it in the most
      striking manner into the interlude of his soliloquy! (p. 146, score). The
      variety and wealth of harmonic transitions in these recitatives is
      astonishing. Mozart's originality is displayed by the way in which he
      gathers to a point the scattered and fugitive emotions of the various
      parts, so as to form a consistent whole. There is not a note which stands
      alone, every separate touch becomes for him a motif, capable of further
      development, and each in its own measure contributes to express the
      situation; the subjects are not strung upon a thread, they are moulded
      into a homogeneous entity. The effect of the melodrama lingers in the
      dramatic character of the instrumental interludes, which is sharply
      emphasised by the great variety of orchestral tone-colouring. An example
      of such character-painting is afforded by the prelude to the High Priest's
      recitative (23), which is in close connection with the scene which is
      being enacted on the stage. It begins maestoso, with a rapid flourish of
      trumpets, drums, and horns&mdash;the King enters with his followers; then
      a largo (of two bars length), stringed instruments and bassoons; the
      priests enter; finally an agitated passage for the violins; the people
      throng tumultuously upon the stage. Then also we have not only the
      stringed quartet, with occasional use of one or other wind instrument, in
      the recitatives, but, wherever it seems advisable the whole orchestra
      <span class="side">ORCHESTRA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p159.png">[159]</a></span> is employed; the wind
      instruments serving to accent and light up the most varied combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings us to one of the most remarkable features of "Idomeneo," which
      at the time rendered the work a true phenomenon, and which even now
      excites admiration and appears worthy of study: the treatment of the
      orchestra. It was to be expected that Mozart, having at his disposal a
      well-appointed and excellently trained orchestra, would develop with
      partiality the instrumental side of his great work. In point of fact, the
      orchestral portions of "Idomeneo" are richer, more brilliant, and more
      carefully carried out, even to the smallest details, than was ever again
      the case in his later works. The composition of the orchestra is quite the
      same as that which he employed in after-times, except that he occasionally
      has four horns, as on some former occasions (Vol. I., p. 304; II., p. 86),
      but not in Vienna. He disposed freely of all the forces at his command,
      not contenting himself any longer with accentuating different parts by
      means of richer instrumentation, but maintaining throughout a more
      brilliant and forcible instrumental colouring, and allowing the choice and
      use of means to be determined only by the particular subject which was to
      be represented. In this manner he kept himself within the bounds of
      moderation, and reserved certain resources for definite effects; for
      instance, flutes are employed only in the storm (18), trombones only for
      the oracle (28). In the choruses to "KÃ¶nig Thamos," on the contrary, the
      trombones are in frequent use, as they were later with similar effect in
      the "ZauberflÃ¶te." So decidedly had Mozart even at that time fixed the
      character of this instrument. But he was particularly careful so to
      distribute his effects that the ear should never be either over-excited or
      over-fatigued. For instance, in the two storm scenes (5, 18) there are no
      trumpets and drums; they first occur in the flight scene, which is quite
      different in character; and again in the dance choruses (10, 32), when
      festive brilliancy is required; also in the mourning chorus, where they
      are muffled, which modifies the effect in a very original manner. These
      observations might advantageously be carried into detail; but it will
      suffice here to point out that Mozart's <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p160.png">[160]</a></span>
      moderation in the use of his instrumental forces, any unusual enrichment
      being more easily perceived in this quarter than in any other, arises
      neither from meagreness of invention nor from a calculated singularity,
      but that he adopts it with clear views and firm control of his own powers.
      Mozart has in "Idomeneo" laid the foundation of all modern
      instrumentation, which has since only been developed in detail, unhappily
      over-developed and perverted. But the most delicate perception of material
      sound effect can only produce superficial results; it should serve merely
      as a cooperating element in true artistic production.<a
      href="#linknote-220015" name="linknoteref-220015" id="linknoteref-220015">
      15 </a> The instruments in the hands of an artist are only transmitters of
      the musical idea in its fixed construction and embodiment, and the same
      loving care which the master displays over harmonious and thematic
      elaboration or characteristic expression appears in his efforts to work on
      the senses of his hearers by means of beautiful orchestral effects. But,
      although the orchestra is perfectly independent, it must not be forgotten
      that it works side by side with the voices, serving as foreground and
      background for them, and never made so prominent as to cause the voices to
      appear only like the accessories in a landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three marches are characteristic, each in its own way. The first (9) is a
      brilliant festival march, belonging by its style to the ballet which
      follows; the second (15), which is introduced in the charming way already
      noticed, is mainly effective by its gradual approach, new instruments
      falling in at each repetition and adding to its force and tone-colouring.
      At first the trumpets and drums are muted, as in the concluding chorus in
      "KÃ¶nig Thamos." The simplest and most <span class="side">BALLET,</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p161.png">[161]</a></span>
      beautiful of the marches is the third (25), which fills a necessary pause
      in the scenic arrangements, but which is full of beautiful expression. The
      employment of the violoncellos is very original; they go for the most part
      with the double-basses, but two octaves higher, which produces an
      excellent effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music to the ballet may most fitly be noticed here. It consists of the
      following numbers:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Chaconne (D major), "Pas de deux de Madame Hartig et M. Antoine," "Pas
      de seul de Madame Falgera," an elaborate movement, with which is connected
      an equally elaborate Larghetto (B flat major). "Pas de seul pour Madame
      Hartig." To a tolerably long Annonce succeeds the Chaconne "pour le
      Ballet," partly repeated, and concluding with a <i>crescendo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. "Pas de seul de M. Le Grand" (D major). This begins with a pathetic
      Intrade (Largo) leading to a neat and compact Allegretto, which was
      omitted in performance. This is followed by a very animated PiÃ¹ allegro,
      and concluded by another PiÃ¹ allegro "pour le Ballet," with a
      twice-repeated triplet passage in long-drawn <i>crescendo</i> rising from
      <i>pp</i> to <i>ff</i>. intensified by suspensions, and which is enough to
      make one giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Passepied (B flat major) "pour Madame Redwen," short and simple, but
      very neat and graceful, and quite in dance form.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Gavotte (G major), not elaborated, delicate and graceful; a very good
      effect is produced by the simple imitation of the violoncello, which is
      carried out in harmony in the third part.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Passecaille (E flat major). This piece was intended for further
      elaboration with a Pas de seul "for M. Antoine," and a Pas de deux (Madame
      Falgera et M. Le Grand), but it was considered too long. Mozart only
      planned two longer portions without completing them, and in performance
      the whole Pas de deux was omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional style of the different dances, as they are known to us
      from the suites of Handel and Bach, has been preserved in their rhythmical
      structure, and also in other <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p162.png">[162]</a></span>
      characteristics; the Passepied, for instance, would have its own place in
      every suite, and so also would the Gavotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, the whole of the ballet music in "Idomeneo" is similar to
      corresponding movements in the opera, fresh, melodious, and appropriate
      throughout. But it is easy to see that Mozart was aware that the delicate
      details and the orchestral treatment that are present throughout the opera
      would not be in place here. It is true that he has done justice to himself
      in the free and flowing arrangement of parts and the animated grouping of
      the instruments, and true also that delicate harmonious transitions
      constantly betray the hand of a master; but he was well aware that he must
      depend chiefly for light and shade on sharp pregnant rhythm and strong
      emphasis. With this view, trumpets and drums are not spared, but the
      orchestra, with the exception of some separate strong strokes, is seldom
      used en masse; there are few attempts after peculiar effects through
      unusual instrumental combinations, and only in the Gavotte does a solo
      violoncello occur, and that in very modest fashion. The influence of the
      ballet-master is apparent from the fact that there are many more erasures
      and alterations in this than in any other part of the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the overture, a magnificent piece, Mozart altogether abandoned the old
      forms. It is in one lively movement, and maintains its character as an
      introduction by not coming to a proper conclusion, but passing immediately
      into the first scene. A certain typical tone of heroic solemnity is heard
      in the first bars, and reiterated more than once afterwards; but the whole
      is governed by a severe earnestness, expressed by the frequent occurrence
      of the minor key, and by the strong but beautiful dissonances. The middle
      subject, on the contrary, begins a gentle plaint in A minor, which is
      calmed and relieved by the wonderfully beautiful introduction of the key
      of C major, enhanced in effect by variety of tone-colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we gather together the results of our observations of "Idomeneo," we
      cannot fail to discern in it the work of a master who has arrived at the
      maturity of his powers while still in the full bloom of youth. It was only
      his <span class="side">GLUCK'S INFLUENCE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p163.png">[163]</a></span> submission to those restraints
      which seemed unavoidable, which prevented his freeing the opera seria from
      the conventionalities which formed, indeed, no essential part of its
      being. Even had he succeeded in doing so, it would have involved no
      renunciation of its national character, which, as we have seen, in no way
      fettered Mozart's individuality. But, since in the improvements he made he
      was indebted to French opera, and especially to Gluck, the question arises
      how much, and in what way, Mozart had learnt from the great Parisian
      master. It is not merely unquestionable that Gluck exerted a general
      influence over Mozart's opinions and tendencies, but the traces of a close
      study of his works, and especially of "Alceste," may be easily discovered.
      He had been present as a boy at the first representation of "Alceste." Its
      influence is apparent in many details, such as the harmonic treatment of
      the oracle, and the use of sustained chords for the horns and trombones in
      the accompaniment to the appeal of the High Priest. The march in "Alceste"
      has served as a model for the style, if not for the execution, of the last
      march in "Idomeneo." The High Priest's soliloquy is altogether analogous
      in plan and treatment to that of Gluck's High Priest; again, the recurring
      subject of the interlude&mdash;[See Page Image] reminds us of the
      corresponding one in "Alceste"&mdash;and other similarities may be
      detected. More important is the similarity of dramatic style, which is
      especially evident in the treatment of the recitatives, and in the share
      taken by the orchestra in the characterisation. But that Mozart learnt
      from Gluck only as one master learns from another, and that he turned his
      borrowed pound to rich account, it needs but a closer consideration of
      these details, as well as <span class="side">IDOMENEO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p164.png">[164]</a></span> of the whole
      work, to make plain. We must not underrate the wholesome and powerful
      effect which grand and important works must have made upon him, and the
      enlightenment and correction of his views as to the nature of the opera
      thereby obtained. But we must also remember that Mozart received these
      impressions and this instruction into a nature self-dependent and
      productive, and that his artistic cultivation enabled him to appropriate
      only what was in accordance with his nature. Gluck sets aside the fixed
      expressions of operatic form as far as is practicable, in order to gain
      perfect freedom of dramatic action; Mozart, on the other hand, strives to
      spare these forms, and so to mould and develop them that they may
      themselves serve as vehicles for dramatic expression. This he does not
      because he clings to what is old and established, but with the just
      perception that these forms contain an essential element of artistic
      construction which is capable of development. Mozart never seeks, as Gluck
      did, to forget that he is a musician; on the contrary, he remembers it at
      every point of his artistic production, and could not ignore the fact if
      he would. In opposition to the one-sided requirements of dramatic
      characterisation, he falls back upon the principles of musical
      construction, which are far from contradicting such requirements, and are
      in fact the higher power which establishes them. On these grounds we
      assert that Mozart's creative power in music (to which we must first turn
      our glance in judging an artist) was more universal and deeper than that
      of Gluck; that he surpassed him in artistic cultivation and discipline
      will be doubted by no one who compares the technical work, the disposition
      of the orchestra, &amp;c., in "Idomeneo" with Gluck's operas. This
      judgment does not exclude the fact that some of Gluck's performances as an
      artist are not only grand and striking, but surpass kindred works by
      Mozart. But if the laws and nature of art are once perceived, a more
      certain rule is provided for the judgment of the work of art as well as of
      the artist; and here Mozart may bear away the palm.

      Mozart's leave of absence was not extorted from the Archbishop without
      difficulty, and it was limited to six weeks.

    <p>

      The better satisfied he became with his life in Munich, where he found
      friends, appreciation, and enlightenment, the more appalling grew the
      prospect of returning to Salzburg, and he was in terror lest the
      Archbishop should recall him even before the performance of the opera.
      With this idea he writes to his father (December 16, 1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ã€ propos!</i> how about the Archbishop? Next Monday I shall have been
      absent from Salzburg for six weeks. You know, my dear father, that it is
      only for love of you that I remain in Salzburg, for, by heaven! if it
      rested with me I would have torn up the agreement and resigned my
      appointment before I left home this time. It is not Salzburg, but the
      prince and the proud nobility who become more insupportable to me every
      day. I should hail with delight a letter informing me that he no longer
      needed my services. The patronage I have here would assure me of present
      and future means of support, without taking into account the chances by
      death, which none ought to count upon, but which is no bad friend to a man
      in search of employment. But anything in the world to please you&mdash;and
      it would come all the easier to me if I could get away now and then for a
      little to take breath. You know how hard it was to get away this time, and
      that without some great cause there is no possibility of it again. Come to
      Munich and hear my opera, and then tell me if I am wrong to feel unhappy
      when I think of Salzburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father seeks to reassure him as to the leave of absence (December 25,
      1780):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the six weeks, I have decided not to take any steps in the
      matter, but if I hear anything on the subject I shall certainly answer
      that we understood you were to remain in Munich six weeks after the
      composition of the opera, for its rehearsal and production, but that I
      could not imagine that his highness would suppose that such an opera could
      be composed, copied, and performed in six weeks, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not, however, have been a matter of regret to L. Mozart if
      Wolfgang could have met with a good situation in Munich. Wolfgang himself
      had been rendered full of hope from the gracious reception of the Elector,
      and wrote to his father that if he succeeded in settling in Munich, he
      (the father) must not long remain in Salzburg, but must follow him
      thither. He was very anxious to demonstrate in Munich that he could write
      other things besides operas, and he turned his church music to account.
      With this object he wrote to his father (November 13, 1780):&mdash;

    <p>
      Be so kind as to send me the scores of the two Masses that I have at home,
      and also the Mass in B flat major (275 K.), for Count Seeau has promised
      to speak of them to the Elector. I should like to make myself known in
      this style. I have just heard a Mass by Grua (kapellmeister in 1779, died
      1826); it would be easy to compose half-a-dozen a day of that kind of
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart also appears to have tried to win favour with the Elector by a new
      church composition; at least a grand Kyrie in D minor (341 K.), judging by
      the character of the composition and the distribution of the orchestra,
      can only have been written during this stay in Munich. The orchestra
      consists of the usual string quartet, and in addition two flutes, two
      oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns (in D and F), two trumpets,
      and drums; there is no grouping of the kind that is found in "Idomeneo."
      Whether this is a fragment of a Mass which was never completed, or whether
      it was intended for insertion in another work, cannot now be decided. It
      is tolerably long, but elaborated without much thematic treatment, the
      elements of the construction and flow being more rhythmical and harmonic,
      and taking their principal charm from the independent and richly
      elaborated orchestral accompaniment. Among Mozart's sacred compositions
      his Kyries are specially distinguished by an originality of tone-colouring
      and peculiarly melodious treatment, which are extremely well suited to the
      melancholy tone of the movement before us. Much of it points to the
      Requiem, and opens the door to conjecture as to the path which Mozart
      would have pursued had he devoted himself specially to church music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another great work, apparently written for the Munich Kapelle, is a grand
      serenata for wind instruments (361 K.),<a href="#linknote-220016"
      name="linknoteref-220016" id="linknoteref-220016"> 16 </a> with the date
      1780, which he must have taken with him, since he would hardly have
      undertaken so important a work while engaged on "Idomeneo." The serenata
      is for two oboes, two clarinets, two viols, four horns, two bassoons,
      violoncello, and double-bass. The instruments, and the task appointed for
      them, point rather to the Munich orchestra <span class="side">SERENATA,

      than to that of Salzburg. Compositions for wind instruments alone, called
      Harmonie-Musik, were then much in favour, and Mozart may have wished to
      recommend himself by producing an important piece of the kind, which would
      place the performances of the band in a brilliant light.<a
      href="#linknote-220017" name="linknoteref-220017" id="linknoteref-220017">

    </p>
    <p>
      In form the serenata resembles those written for the complete orchestra.
      It begins with a solemn Largo, which serves as introduction to a Molto
      allegro, worked out very like the first movement of a symphony. This is
      followed by a Minuet with two trios, than a broadly planned Adagio, and
      again a Minuet with three trios. To this is joined a Romanze (adagio),
      simple and lyrical, in two parts, interrupted by an Allegretto leading
      again to the Adagio, which is repeated and concluded by a coda. Then comes
      an Andante with six variations, and the finale, consisting of a cheerful
      Rondo. It is no easy task to write such a succession of pieces for wind
      instruments, for the tone-colouring, although striking and agreeable, must
      be moderately and carefully treated. People were certainly more accustomed
      to this kind of music at the time, but even at the present day the
      serenata does not produce a sense of fatigue. It has an interest as a
      proof of the minute study which Mozart bestowed on all instrumental
      forces, whereby he acquired that complete mastery of the orchestra which
      is displayed in "Idomeneo."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the work has a higher significance than that of a mere study of
      instrumentation, as is shown by the admiration it has excited in many
      places quite recently. The charm of the composition depends greatly upon
      the certainty with which the peculiar style of each instrument is made use
      of; but this forms only one side of the artistic construction of the idea,
      and the full force and beauty of the instrumental effects are only
      perceived when they are considered as a means of representing each part of
      the whole work in its due proportion.

    <p>
      Great delicacy and diversity are shown in the grouping and treatment of
      the different instruments. The first players naturally undertake the chief
      parts, the accompaniment falling to the secondary players, but the
      disposition of parts is so free and independent that the difference is not
      always apparent.<a href="#linknote-220018" name="linknoteref-220018"
      id="linknoteref-220018"> 18 </a> All the movements are well planned and
      constructed, rich in delicate and interesting touches of harmonic or
      thematic elaboration, and in general fresh and tuneful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crown of them is the Adagio,<a href="#linknote-220019"
      name="linknoteref-220019" id="linknoteref-220019"> 19 </a> in which the
      musical expression of deep and earnest feeling rises to a purity and
      height which is impossible to the specified representations of certain
      frames of mind now in fashion. We here attain, by means of artistic
      catharsis, as Aristotle calls it (<i>purging, purifying</i>), to an
      absolute freedom and satisfaction, which it is granted to man to feel only
      in the perfect harmony and beauty of art. The means by which this highest
      of all effects is reached are so simple that a dissection of them would
      only be a confirmation of the old scripture that the letter killeth and
      the spirit giveth life.<a href="#linknote-220020" name="linknoteref-220020"

      As long as Mozart was engaged on the composition and study of his opera he
      had no time for recreation, and his visits were confined to the Cannabich
      family. After the performance he refreshed himself by entering with his
      father and sister into the Carnival gaieties, and by cheerful intercourse
      with his friends. But the latter did not allow him to remain long in
      idleness. To please his good friend Ramm he wrote a quartet for oboe,
      violin, tenor, and violoncello (370 K.), obbligato throughout for the
      oboe, but otherwise easy and light in design and execution. For his
      patroness the Countess Baumgarten (Vol. II., p. 132) he composed, on March
      8, <span class="side">PROLONGED STAY IN MUNICH.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p169.png">[169]</a></span> 1781, a
      concert aria (369 K.), "Misera dove son" (from Metastasio's "Ezio," III.,
      12), which gives a favourable idea of the vocal performances of this lady.
      It makes no great demands on the compass of the voice or execution, but
      the recitative and air are both earnest and serious, and require in every
      respect an excellent delivery. The instrumentation is simple, only flutes
      and horns being added to the quartet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's longer stay in Munich was rendered possible by the Archbishop's
      journey to Vienna, which was probably occasioned by the death of the
      Empress. He wished to appear with all the pomp of a spiritual prince, and
      took with him a considerable retinue of courtiers and servants, as well as
      some of his most distinguished musicians. Wolfgang rejoiced at this
      fortunate circumstance, and enjoyed himself so much in Munich that he
      confessed later to his father (May 26, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Munich, it is true, I was a little too gay, but I can assure you on my
      honour that before the opera was on the boards I went to no theatre and
      visited no one but Cannabich. I exceeded a little afterwards, I own, but
      it was through youthful folly. I thought to myself, "Where are you to go
      to? To Salzburg. Well, then, enjoy yourself while you can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was full of thought for him even now; he wrote from Munich to
      Breitkopf (February 12, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have long desired that you should publish some work by my son. You will
      not, I am sure, judge of him now by the clavier sonatas which he wrote
      while still a child. You cannot have seen a note of what he has written
      for some years past, unless it may be the six sonatas for clavier and
      violin which were engraved at Paris (Vol. I., p. 415). We have allowed
      very little to appear. You might make the experiment with a couple of
      symphonies or clavier sonatas, or else with quartets, trios, &amp;c. You
      should only give us a few copies in return, as I am anxious that you
      should see my son's manner of work. But do not imagine that I wish to
      over-persuade you. The thought has frequently occurred to me, because I
      see so much published and in print that moves me to pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfgang did not return to Salzburg. His gay life in Munich was
      interrupted by a summons from the Archbishop to Vienna. There he
      accordingly arrived on March 12, and there his destiny was to be
      fulfilled.

      CHAPTER XXIII. RELEASE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE summons to Vienna appeared like the fulfilment of Mozart's ardent and
      long-deferred wish; <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p170.png">[170]</a></span>
      but his relation to the Archbishop, among whose followers he was obliged
      to consider himself, was only too well calculated to turn his delight into
      disappointment. He had apparently the best opportunity of gaining
      admission to the most distinguished society, and of earning fame and money
      in a city where music was the prevailing means of entertainment. But the
      Archbishop, desirous as he was to shine by virtue of the extraordinary
      performers and composers who were in his service, found equal satisfaction
      in keeping them constantly in mind that they <i>were</i> in his service.
      It was the custom for princes when they were invited out to be attended by
      the members of their suite;<a href="#linknote-23001"
      name="linknoteref-23001" id="linknoteref-23001"> 1 </a> and the musicians
      were summoned also to provide music in strange houses. The Archbishop did
      not hesitate to show off Mozart, as well as Ceccarelli and Brunetti, in
      this way, as his own private performers; but as often as Mozart found an
      advantageous opportunity for being heard independently, he refused him
      permission and treated him in all respects like a servant in his house. It
      can be imagined how Mozart felt himself aggrieved by such undignified
      treatment, after the full freedom and recognition of his talents which he
      had enjoyed in Munich, and within reach of such brilliant successes as he
      might have had in Vienna. His letters to his father show how he must have
      longed to throw off his galling chains, and give us a lively picture of
      his position and feelings:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, March 16 (1781), I arrived, God be praised, quite alone, in a
      post-chaise, at nine o'clock in the morning.... Now about the Archbishop.
      I have a charming room in the same house as the Archbishop. Brunetti and
      Ceccarelli are lodged in another house. <i>Che</i> <span class="side">THE
      ARCHBISHOP IN VIENNA, 1781</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p171.png">[171]</a></span> <i>distinzione!</i> My
      neighbour, Herr von Kleinmayern (Director of the Council), overwhelmed me
      with civilities on my arrival. He is really a very pleasant fellow. We
      dine at twelve midday, a little too early for me, unfortunately. The two
      valets in attendance, the controller (E. M. KÃ¶lnberger), Herr Zezi (the
      court quartermaster), the confectioner, two cooks, Ceccarelli, Brunetti,
      and <i>my littleness</i> all dine together. The two valets sit at the head
      of the table, and I have the honour to be placed above the cooks. I can
      imagine myself in Salzburg. During dinner there is a good deal of coarse
      silly joking, but not with me, for I do not speak a word but what I am
      obliged, and that with the greatest circumspection. When I have had my
      dinner I go my way. There is no evening meal provided, but we each receive
      three ducats, and that you know goes a long way! The Archbishop is glad
      enough to glorify himself with his people&mdash;takes their services and
      gives them nothing in return. Yesterday we had music at four o'clock, when
      at least twenty persons of the high nobility were present. Ceccarelli has
      already sung at Palfy's (the Archbishop's brother-in-law). To-day we are
      to go to Prince Gallitzin (the Russian ambassador), who was present
      yesterday. I shall wait to see if I am paid anything; if not I shall go to
      the Archbishop and tell him straight out that if he will not allow me to
      earn anything for myself he must pay me, for that I cannot live on my own
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart, who saw the storm coming, sought to pacify his son by telling
      him that as the Archbishop had summoned him to Vienna in order to glorify
      himself by his performances, he would certainly take care to give him
      opportunities for display; but Wolfgang answers (March 24, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that the Archbishop's vanity is tickled by having me in his
      possession; this may be true, but of what use is it to me? It is not a
      thing to live by. And believe me that he only stands in the way of my
      preferment. How does he treat me? Herr von Kleinmayern and Boenike
      (secretary and councillor) have a special table with the illustrious Count
      Arco; it would be a distinction to sit at this table, instead of being
      with the valets&mdash;who, when they are not taking the first places at
      table, light the candles, shut the doors, and remain in the antechambers&mdash;and
      with the cooks! And when we go to a concert anywhere, the valet waits
      outside until the Salzburgers arrive, and then lets them know by a footman
      that they have permission to enter. Brunetti told me all this, and I
      thought as I listened, "Only wait till I come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day when we went to Prince Gallitzin, Brunetti said to me in his
      nice way, "Mind you are here at six o'clock this evening, and we will go
      together to Prince Gallitzin's: Angelbauer will conduct you. I replied,
      "Very well; but if I am not here at six punctually, do not wait for me; we
      shall be sure to meet there. So I purposely went <span class="side">RELEASE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p172.png">[172]</a></span> alone,
      and when I arrived, there stood Monsieur Angelbauer ready to inform
      Monsieur the footman that he might show me in. But I took not the least
      notice either of the valet or the footman, but went straight through into
      the music-room, all the doors being open, and up to the Prince, to whom,
      after paying my respects, I stood talking for some time. I had quite
      forgotten Brunetti and Ceccarelli, for they kept out of sight behind the
      orchestra, and stood leaning against the wall, without venturing a step
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archbishop also made his musicians play for old Prince Rudolf
      Colloredo, his father, for which they received five ducats, and the
      demands he made on Mozart for his own concerts are shown by a letter to
      the father (April 8, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day we had a concert (for I am writing at eleven o'clock at night) at
      which three pieces by me were performed (new ones, of course)&mdash;a
      rondo to a concerto for Brunetti,<a href="#linknote-23002"
      name="linknoteref-23002" id="linknoteref-23002"> 2 </a> a sonata with
      violin accompaniment for myself, which I composed last night between
      eleven and twelve o'clock; but I had only time to write the accompaniment
      part for Brunetti, and I played my own part out of my head;<a
      href="#linknote-23003" name="linknoteref-23003" id="linknoteref-23003"> 3
      </a> and then a rondo for Ceccarelli, which was encored.<a
      href="#linknote-23004" name="linknoteref-23004" id="linknoteref-23004"> 4
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For all this he received from the Archbishop, who had at least paid him
      four ducats for the first concert, nothing at all. This might pass, but
      shortly afterwards he writes (April 11, 1781): "What makes me half
      desperate is that the same evening that we had that confounded concert the
      Countess Thun invited me. Of course I could not go, and who do you think
      was there? The Emperor! Adamberger <span class="side">VIENNA, 1781.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p173.png">[173]</a></span> and
      Madame Weigl<a href="#linknote-23005" name="linknoteref-23005"
      id="linknoteref-23005"> 5 </a> were there, and each had fifty ducats&mdash;and
      what an opportunity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right, certainly, in saying that the Archbishop stood in the way of
      his preferment, for he had very few opportunities for winning fame or
      success. He renewed his old acquaintance with the Messmer family (pp. 86,
      145), with Herr von Auerhammer and his fat daughter, and with the old
      kapellmeister, Bono. Bono allowed a symphony by Mozart to be rehearsed in
      his house, which, as he reports (April 11, 1781), went splendidly and was
      a great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forty violins played; the wind instruments were all doubled."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no difficulty, either, in gaining admission to the most
      distinguished musical circles:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I go this evening (March 24) with Herr von Kleinmayem to one of his
      friends&mdash;the Councillor Braun&mdash;who, every one tells me, is a
      great amateur of the clavier.<a href="#linknote-23006"
      name="linknoteref-23006" id="linknoteref-23006"> 6 </a> I have already
      dined twice with the Countess Thun, and go there almost every day. She is
      the most charming and amiable woman that I have ever seen, and she thinks
      a great deal of me. I have also dined with Count Cobenzl (court and state
      vice-chancellor). My principal object now is to make myself favourably
      known to the Emperor, for I am determined that he shall know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like to play through my opera to him, and then some good fugues&mdash;that
      is what he has most taste for. Oh! if I had only known that I was to be in
      Vienna during Lent, I would have written a little oratorio, and performed
      it for my own benefit, as is the custom here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could easily have written it beforehand, for I know all the voices here.
      How I should like to give a public concert! but it would not be allowed,
    </p>
    <p>
      I know for certain; for, just imagine! you know that there is a Society
      here which gives concerts for the benefit of the widows of musicians, and
      every one at all connected with music plays there gratis. The orchestra is
      180 strong.<a href="#linknote-23007" name="linknoteref-23007"
      id="linknoteref-23007"> 7 </a> No one who pretends to any philanthropy
      refuses to play when the Society calls upon him to do so; it is a sure way
      also to the favour of the Emperor and of the public. Starzer was <span
      class="side">RELEASE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p174.png">[174]</a></span> commissioned to request me to
      play, and I willingly agreed, subject to the consent of my Prince, of
      which I had little doubt, seeing that it was a religious kind of
      performance, and gratuitous. He refused his permission, however, and all
      the nobility have taken it ill of him. I am only sorry on this account:
      the Emperor is to be in the proscenium box, and I should have preluded
      quite alone, and then played a fugue and the variations, "Je suis Lindor."
      The Countess Thun would have lent me her beautiful pianoforte by Stein for
      the purpose. Whenever I have played the variations in public they have
      been greatly applauded. They are easily understood, and every one finds
      something to his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this instance, however, the Archbishop was obliged to give way. The
      institution for the widows and orphans of Vienna musicians, founded by the
      kapellmeister Florian Gassmann, in 1771, enjoyed the highest patronage;
      and the four concerts given annually for its benefit&mdash;two during
      Advent, and two in Passion week&mdash;were as well supported by celebrated
      composers and performers as by the public. Starzer went to the concert at
      Prince Gallitzin's, and he and all the nobility teased the Archbishop so
      long for his consent that he could not withhold it. "I am so glad!"
      exclaims Mozart, when he informs his father of this.<a
      href="#linknote-23008" name="linknoteref-23008" id="linknoteref-23008"> 8
      </a> The programme of the thirty-fourth concert for the benefit of the
      Society of Musicians at Vienna, on April 3, 1781, contained the following:<a
      href="#linknote-23009" name="linknoteref-23009" id="linknoteref-23009"> 9
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Herr Ritter W. A. Mozart will then perform alone on the pianoforte. He
      visited Vienna as a child of seven years old, and then excited the
      universal admiration of the public by his compositions, his insight into
      the art of music, and his extraordinary facility of touch and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      His success was all that could be desired. "After yesterday," he writes
      (April 4), "I may well say that I am satisfied with the Vienna public. I
      played at the concert for the widows' institution, and was obliged to
      begin twice over, because there was no end to the applause." He refers to
      it again in his next letter (April 8): "That which most pleased and
      surprised me was the total silence, and then in <span class="side">ORDER
      TO RETURN TO SALZBURG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p175.png">[175]</a></span> the middle of my playing bursts
      of applause and bravos. For Vienna, where there are so many and such good
      clavier-players; it has been really a wonderful success."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, his prospects, if he could succeed in giving a concert on his
      own account, were sufficiently brilliant; and ladies of rank offered
      themselves to dispose of the tickets for him. "What should I not make if I
      were to give a concert for myself, now that the Vienna public knows me!
      But the Archbishop will not allow it; he wishes his people to have loss
      rather than profit in his service." He contemplated shortly sending his
      musicians back to Salzburg; if Mozart were to be obliged to leave Vienna
      before he had established himself in the favour of the public, and to find
      himself in Salzburg again, with no hope of any further leave of absence,
      there would be an end to all his future prospects. Brunetti had told him
      that Count Arco had communicated to him the Archbishop's directions that
      they were to receive their travelling money, and to set out on the
      following Sunday; if any wished to remain longer he might do so, but he
      must live on his own means. Mozart declared that until Count Arco himself
      told him that he was to go he would entirely ignore it, and then he would
      tell him his mind on the subject. He would certainly remain in Vienna; he
      thought that if he could find only two pupils (he had one already in the
      Countess Rumbeck), he should be better off than in Salzburg; with a
      successful concert, and some profitable invitations into society, it could
      not be but that he should send money home, while his father would be
      drawing pay for them both, and would be relieved from his support. "Oh! I
      will turn the tables on the Archbishop in the most delightful manner, and
      as politely as possible, for he cannot do me any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was horrified at this news. He had a well-founded distrust of
      Wolfgang's financial plans, which were always built upon an uncertain
      future, and he feared that a complete rupture with the Archbishop would be
      the consequence of such a step, that he would lose his situation and be
      liable for the expenses of the journey to the capital; he earnestly begged
      his son to reflect well on the feasibility <span class="side">RELEASE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p176.png">[176]</a></span> of his
      project. "Dear father," runs the answer, "I love you very dearly, as you
      may see from my renouncing for your sake my dearest wishes and desires;
      for if it were not for you, I declare on my honour I would not delay an
      instant, but would quit my service, give a grand concert, set to work with
      pupils, and in a year I should be succeeding so well in Vienna that I
      should be earning at least a thousand dollars per annum. I assure you it
      is very hard for me so to set aside my hopes of fortune. I am young, as
      you say&mdash;true, but to dawdle away one's youth in such a miserable
      hole is sad enough, and hurtful besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      The threatened departure was postponed for a time, for the Archbishop
      required his performers in Vienna; then it was said that they were to
      return home on April 22. "When I think," wrote Wolfgang (April 11, 1781)
      "of leaving Vienna without at least a thousand florins in my pocket, my
      heart sinks within me. Am I to throw away a thousand gulden because of a
      malicious prince who does what he likes with me for a miserable four
      hundred florins? I should make quite that by a concert." And now he was to
      come to the knowledge that not only had he laboured in vain for the
      Archbishop, but that he had thereby lost the opportunity of introducing
      himself to the notice of the Emperor. "I cannot quite say to the Emperor
      that if he wants to hear me he must make haste about it, for that I am
      going away on such a day&mdash;one has to wait for these things. And here
      I cannot and must not stay, unless I give a concert, for although I should
      be better off here than at home, if I had only two pupils, it helps one
      along to have a thousand or twelve hundred florins in one's purse. And he
      will not allow it, the misanthrope&mdash;I must call him so, for so he is,
      as the whole of the nobility say." There were favourable prospects, too,
      of a permanent settlement in Vienna at no very distant date. The
      kapellmeister, Bono, was very old; after his death Salieri would succeed
      him, and Starzer would take Salieri's place&mdash;for Starzer there was as
      yet no successor&mdash;could a better be found than Mozart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his father warned him not to make uncertain plans, but to hold fast
      to what was secure, and to bear what was <span class="side">PROSPECTS IN
      VIENNA, 1781.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p177.png">[177]</a></span>
      unavoidable; he warned him also against incautious expressions "which
      could only do harm." Wolfgang could only answer that his father was partly
      right and partly wrong; "but that in which you are right far outweighs
      that in which you are wrong, therefore I will certainly come, and with the
      greatest pleasure, since I am fully convinced that you would never come in
      the way of my advancement" (April 18, 1781). But it was hard to submit to
      the will of his father, and the Archbishop's continual insults did not
      make it any easier. He writes (April 28, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You are expecting me with pleasure, my dearest father! That is in fact the
      one consideration which has brought me to the point of leaving Vienna, for
      the whole world may know that the Archbishop of Salzburg has only to thank
      you, my best of fathers, that he did not lose me yesterday for ever (I
      mean, of course, from his suite). Yesterday we had a concert, probably the
      last. The concert went very well, and, in spite of all the hindrances put
      in my way by his archiepiscopal grace, I had a better orchestra than
      Brunetti, as Ceccarelli can tell you; but the worry and trouble I had to
      arrange it all can be told better than written. But if, as I hope will not
      be the case, the same thing should happen again, I should certainly lose
      patience, and you would as certainly forgive me. And I must beg for your
      permission, my dear father, to return to Vienna next Lent. It depends upon
      you, not on the Archbishop; for even if he refuses permission I shall go:
      it will do me no harm, not a bit! Oh, if he could read this, how glad I
      should be! But you must give your consent in your next letter, for it is
      only on this condition that I return to Salzburg&mdash;and I must keep my
      word to the ladies here. Stephanie will give me a German opera to write. I
      shall expect your answer to this. When and how I shall set out I cannot
      tell you at present. It is lamentable that we are so kept in the dark by
      our lord and master. All at once it will be, "Allons! weg!" First we are
      told that a carriage is being made in which the controller Ceccarelli and
      I are to travel; then that we are to go by the diligence; then that we are
      to have the money for the diligence, and travel as we choose (which,
      indeed, I should like best of all); first we are to go in a week, then in
      a fortnight; then in three weeks, then again sooner. Good heavens! one
      does not know where one is with it all, and there is no help for it.
      Yesterday the ladies kept me quite an hour at the clavier, after the
      concert; I believe I should be sitting there still if I had not managed to
      steal away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he writes later (June 13, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last concert, when it was all over, I played variations for a whole
      hour (the Archbishop gave me the subject), and the applause was <span
      class="side">RELEASE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p178.png">[178]</a></span> so great that, if the Archbishop
      has ever so little of a human heart, he must have been pleased; and
      instead of showing me approbation and content&mdash;or at least taking no
      notice of me&mdash;he treats me like a beggar, and tells me to my face
      that I must take more pains, that he could get a hundred who would serve
      him better than I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's passionate excitement had risen to such a pitch that a drop was
      sufficient to overflow the cup of his wrath; the Archbishop paid no heed,
      and affairs came to an inevitable crisis. The following letter (May 9,
      1781) shows how far Hieronymus thought he might go with his dependents:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still overflowing with gall, and you, my best and very dear father,
      will certainly sympathise with me. My patience has been tried for a long
      time; at last it has given way. I have no longer the misfortune to be in
      the Salzburg service. To-day was the happy one of my release. Now listen.
      Twice already the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I do not know what to call
      him&mdash;has used the most impertinent and coarsest language to my face,
      which I refrained from writing to you that I might not distress you, and
      which nothing but my love and duty to you prevented me from chastising on
      the spot. He called me a scoundrel&mdash;a miserable fellow&mdash;told me
      he would send me packing&mdash;and I bore it all; allowed not my own
      honour alone, but yours, to be so affronted because you wished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was silent. Well, listen. A week ago the courier came up on a sudden
      and told me I was to leave immediately. The others all had the day fixed,
      but I had not. So I packed up my things as quickly as I could, and old
      Madame Weber was so kind as to offer me her house. There I have a pretty
      room, and I am with obliging people who are ready to provide me with
      everything that I require, but could not get if I were living alone. I
      appointed my journey for Wednesday (that is to-day, the 9th), by
      stage-coach, but I could not collect the money owing to me in time, so I
      postponed my journey until Saturday. Being seen about to-day one of the
      valets told me that the Archbishop had a parcel to give me. I asked if
      there was any hurry, and he replied that it was of the greatest
      importance. "Then I am sorry not to be able to oblige his grace, for
      (owing to the above reasons) I cannot set out before Saturday. I am out of
      the house, living on my own means, and it is therefore quite evident that
      I cannot go until I am ready, for no one will care to collect my debts for
      me." Kleinmayern, Moll, Boeneke, and the two valets thought I was right.
      When I went in to him (I must tell you that Schlaucka had advised me to
      excuse myself by saying I had already taken my seat in the coach&mdash;that
      would have most weight with him)&mdash;when I went into him, then, he
      began at once:&mdash;Archbishop: "Well, when are you going, fellow?"
      Mozart: "I wished to go to-night, but I could not secure a seat." Then out
      it came, all in a breath&mdash;that I was the most miserable fellow he
      knew&mdash;no one served him so badly as <span class="side">MOZART RESIGNS
      HIS POST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p179.png">[179]</a></span>
      I did. He advised me to be off to-day, or he would write home to stop my
      pay. There was no getting in a word, it went on like a flood. I listened
      to it all calmly. He lied to my face by saying that I had five hundred
      florins salary<a href="#linknote-230010" name="linknoteref-230010"
      id="linknoteref-230010"> 10 </a>&mdash;called me the most opprobrious
      names&mdash;oh, I really cannot bring myself to write you all! At last,
      when my blood was boiling, I could hold out no longer, and said: "Then
      your Serene Highness is not satisfied with me?" "What! do you mean to
      threaten me, you rascal, you villain? There is the door; I will have
      nothing more to do with such a wretched fellow!" At last I said, "Neither
      will I with you." "Then be off!" As I went I said, "Let it be so then;
      to-morrow you shall hear from me by letter." Tell me now, dear father,
      should I not have had to say this sooner or later? Now listen. My honour
      comes before everything to me, and I know that it is so with you also.
      Have no care for me. I am so certain of success here that I might have
      resigned even without a cause. As I have had very good cause, and that
      three times, it is no fault of mine; <i>au contraire</i>, I was a cowardly
      rascal twice, and the third time I could not be so again. As long as the
      Archbishop is here I will give no concert. Your idea that I shall lower
      myself in the opinion of the Emperor or of the nobility is entirely
      mistaken. The Archbishop is hated here, and most of all by the Emperor.
      That is his real grievance, that the Emperor has not invited him to
      Laxenburg. I will send you some calculations as to money by the next post
      to convince you that I shall not starve here. For the rest I entreat you
      to keep up your spirits, for I consider that my good fortune is beginning
      now, and I hope that it will be yours also. Write to me privately that you
      are pleased&mdash;for indeed you may be so&mdash;and find fault heartily
      with me in public, so that no blame may attach to you. But if the
      Archbishop offers you the least impertinence come to me at once in Vienna.
      We can all three live on my earnings, I assure you on my word, but I would
      rather you held out a year longer. Do not write to me any more at the
      Residence or by the mail. I want to hear nothing more of Salzburg. I hate
      the Archbishop to frenzy. But write to me here, and tell me you are
      pleased, for only that is now wanting to make my happiness complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried out His determination, and writes to his father again on May
      12:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You know by my last letter that I sent in my resignation to the Prince on
      May 9, because he himself ordered it: for in two previous audiences he had
      said to me, "Take yourself off, if you will not serve me properly!" He
      will certainly deny it, but it is as true as the heavens above us. What
      wonder, then, that after being abused and vilified till I was quite <span
      class="side">RELEASE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p180.png">[180]</a></span> beside myself, I ended by taking
      him at his word. The following day I gave Count Arco a petition to be
      presented to His Grace the Archbishop, asking for the money for the
      journey&mdash;fifteen florins ten kreutzers for the diligence, and two
      ducats for current expenses. He refused to take either, and assured me I
      could not resign without obtaining the consent of my father. "That is your
      duty," said he. I assured him that I knew my duty to my father as well as
      he and perhaps better, and that I should be sorry if it were necessary to
      learn it from him at this time of day. "Very well, then," said he, "if he
      is satisfied you may demand your dismissal, and if not&mdash;you may also
      demand it." A fine distinction, truly! All that the Archbishop said to me
      in the three audiences&mdash;especially in the last&mdash;and the language
      used by this truly worthy man of God, had so strong a physical effect on
      me that I was obliged to leave the opera at the end of the first act, and
      go home to bed; for I was quite feverish, trembled in every limb, and
      tottered along the street like a drunkard. I remained the next day
      (yesterday) in the house, and kept my bed in the morning because I had
      taken the tamarind-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord Count has had the kindness to write some fine things of me to his
      father (High Chamberlain), which you have doubtless had to swallow by this
      time. There will be some fabulous accounts, but when one writes a comedy
      one must turn and twist things so as to gain applause, without sticking to
      the truth of the affair, and you must take the obsequiousness of the Count
      into account. I will tell you without getting warm about it (for I have no
      wish to injure my health, and I am sorry enough when I am forced to be
      angry), I will tell you plainly the principal reproach made to me on
      account of my service. I did not know that I was to be a valet, and that
      undid me. I should have dawdled away a couple of hours every morning in
      the antechamber; I was in fact often told that I ought to show myself, but
      I could never remember that this was part of my duty, and contented myself
      with coming punctually when I was summoned by the Archbishop. Now I will
      briefly convey to you my unalterable determination, so that the whole
      world may hear it. If I was offered two thousand florins by the Archbishop
      of Salzburg, and only one thousand florins in any other place, I would go
      to the other place; for instead of the other one thousand florins I should
      enjoy health and contentment of mind. I pray you, therefore&mdash;by all
      the fatherly love that you have shown me in so rich a measure from my
      childhood, and for which I can never be sufficiently grateful&mdash;not to
      write to me on this matter, but to bury it in the deepest oblivion if you
      want to see your son cheerful and well; a word would be quite enough to
      rekindle my anger&mdash;and yours, if you were in my place, as I am sure
      you will acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day on which Mozart sent this letter through the post he wrote
      another to his father by a safe opportunity, in which he once more seeks
      to persuade him of the justice <span class="side">JUSTIFICATION.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p181.png">[181]</a></span> of his
      fixed resolve to leave the Archbishop's service, and of his own good
      prospects in Vienna:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the letter which you will have received by post I spoke as though we
      were in the presence of the Archbishop; now I speak to you quite alone, my
      dear father. We will be silent once for all on the subject of the
      Archbishop's conduct to me from the beginning of his reign&mdash;of the
      unceasing abuse, the impertinence and bad language which he has addressed
      to my face, of the unquestionable right I have to forsake his service&mdash;not
      a word can be said against all this. I will only speak now of what has
      really induced me to leave him, laying aside all personal grounds of
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made the highest and most valuable acquaintances here that can be.
      I am treated with favour and distinction in the best houses of the
      nobility, and I am paid for it into the bargain; and shall I sacrifice all
      this for four hundred florins in Salzburg, without prospects, without
      encouragement, and unable to help you in any way, as I certainly shall
      hope to do here? What would be the end of it? It would come to the same
      thing. I should either fret myself to death or leave the service. I need
      say no more, you know it all yourself; I will only add that my story is
      known to the whole of Vienna, and all the nobility advise me not to suffer
      myself to be led about any longer. He will try to get over you with good
      words, my dear father&mdash;they are serpents, vipers! It is always so
      with such despicable creatures, they are so haughty and proud as to
      disgust one, and then they cringe and fawn&mdash;horrible. The two
      valets-de-chambre understand the whole villainy of the affair. Schlaucka
      said to somebody: "I cannot say I think Mozart at all in the wrong: he is
      quite right. I would have done just the same myself! He treated him like a
      beggar; I heard it myself. Shameful!" The Archbishop acknowledges to being
      in the wrong now; but had he not opportunities enough for acknowledging it
      before? And did he alter his conduct? Not a bit. Then away with all that!
      If I had not been afraid of doing you some harm I would have brought it to
      an end long ago. But, after all, what harm can he do you? None. If you
      know that I am doing well you can dispense with the Archbishop's favour.
      He cannot deprive you of your salary as long as you perform your duties,
      and I will answer for it that I shall do well, otherwise I should not have
      taken this step. Nevertheless I acknowledge that after this insult I
      should have resigned, if I had had to beg my bread. If you are at all
      afraid, make a show of anger against me&mdash;blame me as much as you like
      in your letters, if only we two know how the matter really stands. But do
      not be deceived by flattery. Be upon your guard!
    </p>
    <p>
      But L. Mozart did not see the affair in this light, and was far from
      "strengthening his decision instead of dissuading him from it," as
      Wolfgang hoped. He considered the <span class="side">RELEASE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p182.png">[182]</a></span> renunciation
      of the Salzburg situation as the first step to ruin, and hoped to check
      the passionate indignation of his son and bring him back to the path of
      reason, as he considered it. But he had not calculated on the fact that
      Wolfgang was no longer an inexperienced youth, leaving his father's house
      for the first time. The oppressive circumstances of his late residence in
      Salzburg, and the clear insight into his own powers and capabilities which
      he had acquired in Munich, had given him a consciousness of the necessity
      of judging for himself, which had been strengthened by the contrast
      between the unworthy treatment of the Archbishop and the brilliant
      reception he had met with on the part of the musical public of Vienna. He
      saw clearly that the time had arrived when he must hold his own, even in
      opposition to his father. His comfort and convenience he was ready and
      willing to sacrifice to his father's wishes, but his honour and the credit
      of his whole existence were now at stake, and these he must save at all
      risks. He withstood, therefore, all his father's remonstrances and
      reproaches without betraying his wounded feelings. To his father's
      objection that he had never understood how to take care of his money,
      Wolfgang answers (May 21, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, I have quite changed in that respect. Next to health, I know
      of nothing more necessary than money. I am indeed no niggard&mdash;I
      should find it very hard to be niggardly&mdash;and yet people consider me
      more inclined to thrift than extravagance, which is surely enough for a
      beginning. Thanks be to my pupils, I have as much as I want; but I will
      not have many pupils, I prefer few, and to be better paid than other
      teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more affected by the allusion to the obligation he was under to his
      father, by reason of the debts incurred by the latter on his behalf,
      especially since his father added that he would soon forget his family in
      Vienna, as his Aloysia had done. He answered (June 9, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your comparison of me to Madame Lange amazed me, and I was troubled by it
      the whole day. This girl lived dependent on her parents while she could
      earn nothing, and as soon as the time arrived when she might have shown
      her gratitude (her father died before she had received a kreutzer) she
      left her poor mother, took up with an actor, married <span class="side">L.

    <p>
      I write that I can do it better here than in Salzburg? I beseech you, my
      dear, good father, write me no more such letters, for they serve no
      purpose but to annoy and trouble me; and if I am to go on composing as I
      do, I must keep a cool head and a calm mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent his father at the same time thirty ducats, with an apology for not
      being able to spare more at present, and in following years we find
      repeated mention of money sent home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been reported to L. Mozart that Wolfgang was living a somewhat
      dissipated life in Vienna; Herr von Moll, in particular, "made a wry face,
      and said he hoped he would soon come to himself and return to Salzburg,
      for he only remained in Vienna for the sake of bad connections." It was
      reported to his father that Wolfgang had had dealings with a person of bad
      reputation, but he was able to reassure his father on this point. L.
      Mozart had been rendered uneasy, too, on the subject of his son's
      attention to religious duties. Wolfgang begs him to be under no
      apprehension, he is, no doubt, "a foolish young fellow," but he would wish
      for his consolation that no one was more so than he. Eating meat on
      fast-days he thought no sin, "for fasting I consider to be abstaining&mdash;eating
      less than at other times," but he never made a boast of this; he heard
      mass every Sunday and holy-day, and as often as possible on ordinary days.
      "Altogether you may rest assured that I have not deserted my religion.
      You, perhaps, believe things of me that are not true, for my chief fault
      is that I cannot always act <i>in</i> <span class="side">RELEASE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p184.png">[184]</a></span> <i>appearance</i>
      as I ought to act" (June 13, 1781). Wolfgang's renewed intercourse with
      the Weber family appeared to his father of ill omen; he dreaded another
      love affair. This also his son repudiates (May 16, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What you write concerning the Weber family is, I assure you, without
      foundation. I was a fool about Madame Lange, that is true; but who is not
      when he is in love? I loved her in very deed, and I still feel that she is
      not altogether indifferent to me. Luckily for me her husband is a jealous
      fool, and never leaves her alone, so that I rarely see her. Believe me
      also that old Madame Weber is a very obliging person, and that I only fail
      in showing her the attention her obligingness deserves; I have not time
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finally his father went so far as to demand that Wolfgang should
      sacrifice his honour by recalling his resignation, he answered in the full
      consciousness of the justice of his position (May 19, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely know how to write to you, my dear father, for I cannot recover
      from my astonishment, and I shall never be able to do so as long as you
      continue so to write and to think. I must acknowledge that I scarcely
      recognise my father in some of the passages of your letter! It is a father
      who writes, certainly, but not the best, most loving father, the one most
      anxious for his own honour and that of his children&mdash;in a word, not
      <i>my</i> father. But it must have been a dream. You are awake by this
      time, and need no reply from me on the various points of your letter in
      order to be convinced that I cannot, now less than ever, depart from my
      resolution. You say the only way to preserve my honour is to renounce my
      intention. How can you utter such a contradiction? You could not have
      realised, in writing this, that such a renunciation would turn me into one
      of the most cowardly fellows in the world. All Vienna knows that I have
      left the Archbishop, knows the reason to be my injured honour, knows of
      the thrice-repeated insults of the Archbishop; and am I all at once to
      retract my word and belie myself? Shall I announce myself as a scoundrel,
      and the Archbishop as a worthy prince? The first no man shall ever do, and
      I least of all; and the second no one can do but God himself, if He should
      deign to enlighten him. To please you, my dear father, I would renounce my
      happiness, my health, and life itself, but my honour comes before all with
      me, and so it must with you. My dearest, best of fathers, demand of me
      what you will, only not that&mdash;anything but that. The very thought
      makes me tremble with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archbishop was not a little taken aback by the firmness with which
      Mozart held to his resolve, but which he <span class="side">COUNT ARCO
      INSULTS MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p185.png">[185]</a></span>
      only strengthened by his continual abuse, without bringing the Viennese
      round to his side. They all looked upon him as a "haughty, ill-bred
      priest, despised by everybody," while Mozart was "an agreeable fellow."
      The Archbishop imagined that Mozart's father would bring his son to a
      sense of his duty; Count Arco, who had received a letter from the elder
      Mozart, proposed an interview, in the hope of persuading him in a friendly
      way. Mozart remained all the firmer when he had convinced himself that his
      father in Salzburg had nothing to fear. He begged for an audience to take
      leave, but this was three times refused, because it was feared to irritate
      the Archbishop, and Mozart's submission was still hoped for. The latter
      was beside himself when he heard that the Archbishop was to leave next
      day, and that he had not been informed of it. He drew up a fresh memorial,
      in which he explained that he had waited four weeks for a final audience;
      as this had been postponed so long from reasons unknown to him, he had no
      resource but to beg for it himself at the last moment. When he found
      himself in the antechamber, in pursuance of this intention (June 8), and
      prayed for an audience, Count Arco put the finishing touch to the
      brutalities suffered by Mozart. After loading him with abusive epithets,
      <i>he pushed him towards the door with his foot!</i> "This happened in the
      antechamber&mdash;there was therefore nothing for it but to make my
      escape, for I did not wish to forget the respect due to the Prince's
      apartments, although Arco had done so." Whether this affront was offered
      by command of the Archbishop, Mozart did not know certainly; but, in any
      case, the servant was worthy of his master, and neither of them could
      foresee the ineffaceable stigma that would thereby be attached to their
      names. Mozart boiled over with rage; he answered his father that he should
      return the insult in kind the next time he met Count Arco, even if it were
      in the public streets:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall demand no satisfaction at the hands of the Archbishop, for he
      would not be in a position to offer it me in the way that I shall take it;
      but I shall at once write to the Count what he has to expect from me the
      first time I am so fortunate as to meet him, wherever it may be, unless it
      should be some place to which I owe respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p186.png">[186]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was alarmed at such threats addressed to a nobleman; but
      Wolfgang answered (July 20, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart shows the true nobleman, and, although I am no Count, I am more
      honourable perhaps than many a Count; and whether it be a footman or a
      Count, whoever insults me is a scoundrel. I shall begin by representing to
      him how low and ungentlemanly his conduct was; but I shall conclude by
      telling him that he may certainly expect a thrashing from me the first
      time I meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father having remarked that the matter might perhaps be arranged by
      the intervention of a lady or of some other person of rank, Mozart
      answered that this was not necessary: "I shall take counsel only of my
      good sense and my heart, and shall do what is right and proper." It was
      only with reluctance, and because he saw no other way of pacifying his
      father, that he consented to forego the threatening letter to Count Arco.

      CHAPTER XXIV. FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN Mozart's withdrawal from the service<span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p186.png">[186]</a></span> of the Archbishop had become an
      established fact, the latter was anxious to show the world that it lay in
      his power to attract equally distinguished artists to his service, and he
      offered a salary of one thousand gulden to Leop. Kozeluch, who was
      considered the first clavier-player in Vienna, if he would come to
      Salzburg. Kozeluch refused, as Mozart wrote to his father (July 4, 1781),
      because he was better off in Vienna, and he had said to his friends: "The
      affair with Mozart is what chiefly alarms me; if he could let such a man
      as that leave him, what would become of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart, much against his will, was obliged to reconcile himself to the
      step his son had taken.<a href="#linknote-24001" name="linknoteref-24001"
      id="linknoteref-24001"> 1 </a> He was full of <span class="side">WORK IN
      VIENNA, 1781.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p187.png">[187]</a></span>
      anxiety, caused by his conviction of Wolfgang's incapacity in matters
      relating to his own advancement, by his fear lest he should not be able to
      withstand the seductions of the pleasure-loving capital, and also,
      perhaps, by an unconscious feeling of annoyance at his son's independent
      demeanour. This caused him to express his affectionate and really
      justifiable concern in so perverse a manner that, instead of lightening
      Wolfgang's difficult position, he embittered his life with reproaches and
      objections, which were generally exaggerated, and often entirely
      unreasonable; for he was weak enough to place easy faith in rumours and
      gossip. He had so long been accustomed to undertake the care of all
      Wolfgang's affairs that he could not bring himself quietly to resign all
      interference in them. Mozart did not allow himself to be over-persuaded;
      he held fast to his independence, as well as to his reverence and love for
      his father, whose reproofs and accusations he repeatedly disclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, indeed, the father's gloomy forebodings seemed more likely to be
      verified than the brilliant hopes of the son. Summer had arrived, most of
      the nobility had gone to their country seats, and there was little to be
      done in the way of lessons or concerts. The Countess Rumbeck (<i>nÃ©e</i>
      Cobenzl), who was afterwards considered a first-rate clavier-player,<a
      href="#linknote-24002" name="linknoteref-24002" id="linknoteref-24002"> 2
      </a> remained his only pupil, since he would not abate his price of six
      ducats; but he managed to exist in spite of all. He consoled himself by
      the reflection that it was the dull season, and that he must employ his
      leisure by preparing for the winter. He worked diligently at six sonatas
      for the clavier, which were to be published by subscription; the Countess
      Thun and other ladies of rank undertook to collect subscriptions. They
      secured seventeen during the summer, and hoped for more in the autumn. He
      set to work to arrange a concert to be given during Advent; Rossi wrote
      the words for an Italian cantata which was to be composed for the
      occasion. But what lay nearest his heart was the composition of an opera
      in Vienna; his conviction of his vocation as a dramatic composer having
      been strengthened <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p188.png">[188]</a></span> by the
      performances at the Vienna theatre, and the lively interest taken in them
      by the public. "My only entertainment," he writes to his sister (July 4,
      1781), "consists in the theatre. I wish you could see a tragedy performed
      here! I know no other theatre where every kind of play is given to
      perfection. Every part, even the smallest and the worst, is well filled."
      The performances of the Vienna stage had, in point of fact, reached the
      highest level of excellence known at that time.<a href="#linknote-24003"
      name="linknoteref-24003" id="linknoteref-24003"> 3 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the time when the stage had joined in the struggle which ended in
      the triumph of German literature and art over buffoonery and extemporised
      pieces, the theatre had remained the gathering-point of literary
      interests. The best authors of the day wrote for the stage with the avowed
      object of improving taste and aiding the spread of culture; such were
      Klemm, Heufeld, Ayrenhoff, and Gebler, and their efforts were ably
      seconded by such actors as MÃ¼ller and the brothers Stephanie.<a
      href="#linknote-24004" name="linknoteref-24004" id="linknoteref-24004"> 4
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The new and difficult task appointed for them spurred the actors to
      extraordinary efforts. A general feeling of sympathy and esteem began to
      replace the contempt in which the dramatic art had been held, and the
      stage was soon looked upon as the gauge of a nation's moral and
      intellectual cultivation. This elevation of the art as a whole benefited
      the artists as individuals, the interdict which society had laid upon them
      was removed, and actors became favoured members of the best and most
      cultivated circles.<a href="#linknote-24005" name="linknoteref-24005"
      id="linknoteref-24005"> 5 </a> The Vienna theatre in especial, since
      Joseph II. in the year 1776 had saved it from the weakening influence of
      variable private patronage, and had constituted it the court and national
      theatre, had rapidly reached to an unprecedented height of excellence.
      This monarch looked upon the theatre as an important means of national
      cultivation, took a lively interest in it, and shared himself in its
      practical management; he also watched over the talents and the destinies
      <span class="side">THE VIENNA STAGE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p189.png">[189]</a></span> of his actors with shrewd
      penetration and warm sympathy.<a href="#linknote-24006"
      name="linknoteref-24006" id="linknoteref-24006"> 6 </a> He was careful, by
      lowering the prices of admission,<a href="#linknote-24007"
      name="linknoteref-24007" id="linknoteref-24007"> 7 </a> to make attendance
      at the theatre more general than it had hitherto been; and an
      entertainment, which had borne almost exclusively the character of a court
      festival or an assembly of persons of rank, was thus placed within the
      reach of the citizen class.<a href="#linknote-24008"
      name="linknoteref-24008" id="linknoteref-24008"> 8 </a> Literary criticism
      too, let loose by the introduction of the liberty of the press, turned its
      attention to the drama, and enlightened the general reader on the quality
      of the entertainment afforded to him by the author and by the actor. In
      this way a public was educated without reference to rank or class, to whom
      the poet and musician could appeal as an independent artist, instead of
      ministering as heretofore exclusively to the entertainment of his patrons&mdash;a
      state of affairs which must have had important influence on the position
      of artists, more especially of musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical public of Vienna at the time of which we are speaking had
      the reputation of being attentive, discerning, and appreciative, ready and
      liberal in its acknowledgment of what was good.<a href="#linknote-24009"
      name="linknoteref-24009" id="linknoteref-24009"> 9 </a> And in truth it
      had cause. Shortly before Mozart came to Vienna, Schroder and his wife had
      set the crown on admirable acting; and associated with them were MÃ¼ller,
      Lange, Weidman, Brockmann, Jacquet, Bergopzoomer, the brothers Stephanie,
      Mesdames Weidner, Adamberger, Jacquet, Sacco, Stierle, Rouseul&mdash;affording
      proof that Mozart did not overrate the talent of his contemporaries.<a
      href="#linknote-240010" name="linknoteref-240010" id="linknoteref-240010">
      10 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same spirit in which he had founded the national theatre Joseph II.
      abolished the costly spectacular ballet and the Italian opera. In the
      place of the latter he instituted a "national vaudeville," as he called
      the German <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p190.png">[190]</a></span> opera.<a
      href="#linknote-240011" name="linknoteref-240011" id="linknoteref-240011">
      11 </a> In December, 1777, he resolved to make a modest beginning with the
      forces which he had at his command. Umlauf, tenorist in the orchestra, had
      written the little operetta of "Die Bergknappen," in which only four
      characters appeared. The principal part was intended for Mdlle. Cavalieri,
      the second for Madame Stierle; the male parts were to be undertaken by
      Ruprecht, the tenor singer, and Fuchs, the bass; the chorus was composed
      of church choristers, and the management was entrusted to MÃ¼ller, the
      actor. The rehearsals were very carefully made, and the Emperor having
      expressed his satisfaction at a dress rehearsal, the German opera was
      opened with "Die Bergknappen" on February 18. 1778. The performance was
      highly successful,<a href="#linknote-240012" name="linknoteref-240012"
      id="linknoteref-240012"> 12 </a> and in the course of the following year
      fourteen operas or vaudevilles were performed, partly translations, with
      Italian or French music, such as "Robert und Kalliste" ("La Sposa
      Fedele"), by Guglielmi; "RÃ¶schen und Colas," by Monsigny; "Lucile,"
      "Silvain," "Der Hausfreund," by GrÃ©try; "Anton und Antonette," by Gossec;
      and partly original pieces composed in Vienna, such as "Die Apotheke," by
      Umlauf; "Die Kinder der Natur," by Aspelmeyer; "FrÃ¼hling und Liebe," by
      Ulbrich; and "Diesmal hat der Mann den Willen," by Ordonnez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only singer of lasting reputation who took part in the first opera was
      Katharina Cavalieri (1761-1801). Daughter of a poor schoolmaster named
      Cavalier in WÃ¤hring, her talent was perceived and cultivated by Salieri,
      and she appeared in Italian opera as early as 1775. She soon became a
      bravura singer of the first rank.<a href="#linknote-240013"
      name="linknoteref-240013" id="linknoteref-240013"> 13 </a> It was clearly
      necessary that she should be well supported if the opera was to compete
      with the drama proper. The first wife of the <span class="side">GERMAN
      OPERETTA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p191.png">[191]</a></span>
      actor Lange, Mariane Schindler, was secured; but after having achieved
      great success in GrÃ©tr's "Hausfreund" and "Lucile," and bidding fair to
      become a main support of the opera, both by her singing and acting, she
      died in the winter of 1779.<a href="#linknote-240014"
      name="linknoteref-240014" id="linknoteref-240014"> 14 </a> The following
      summer, through the intervention of the ambassador, Count Hardeck, Aloysia
      Weber was summoned from Munich, and took her place, not only on the stage,
      but in the affections of Lange, who shortly after made her his second
      wife. Aloysia Weber made her <i>dÃ©but</i> in the part of the RosenmÃ¤dchen
      of Salency, and was received with general approbation.<a
      href="#linknote-240015" name="linknoteref-240015" id="linknoteref-240015">
      15 </a> It was evident, therefore, that Mozart was not blinded by youthful
      inclination when, he declared her one of the first singers of her time, a
      judgment which posterity has ratified. The second parts had been allotted
      before her arrival to Theresa Teyber, afterwards Madame Arnold, who
      pleased by her fresh, youthful voice, while that of Madame Fischer (<i>nÃ©e</i>
      Strasser), from Mannheim, a clever singer and good actress, was already
      somewhat past. In the summer of 1781 they had been joined by Madame
      Bernasconi (p. 130), by the desire, as it was said, of Gluck, who had used
      the influence of Count Dietrichstein to press her on the Emperor; but the
      position was not well suited to her talent. Mozart gives his opinion as
      follows (August 29, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great parts of tragedy Bernasconi remains inimitable. But small
      operettas are not in her style at all; and then (as she acknowledges
      herself) she is more Italian than German, speaks on the stage with the
      same Viennese accent as in common life (just imagine!), and when she
      occasionally makes an effort it is as if one heard a princess declaim in a
      marionette theatre. And she sings so badly that no one will consent to
      compose for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even before this (June 27, 1781) he had written derisively:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She has three hundred ducats salary because she sings all her songs a
      division higher than they are written. It is really a great art, for she
      keeps well in tune. She has now promised to sing them half a tone higher,
      and then of course she will be paid more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p192.png">[192]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      There were male singers also, who were quite on an equality with these
      female vocalists. Soon after the opening of the opera the tenors Souter
      and Dauer, a whimsical actor with a fine voice,<a href="#linknote-240016"
      name="linknoteref-240016" id="linknoteref-240016"> 16 </a> were engaged,
      and at a later date Adamberger, one of the most admirable tenors, a singer
      of artistic style and cultivation, and a "very respectable" actor of
      lovers' parts. Fischer was secured as a bass; the compass, strength, and
      beauty of his voice and his artistic cultivation, both as a singer and an
      actor, placed him in the very first rank among the singers of Germany.
      With him were associated GÃ¼nther and Schmidt as bass singers, and Saal as
      a baritone.<a href="#linknote-240017" name="linknoteref-240017"
      id="linknoteref-240017"> 17 </a> There were thus all the materials
      required for the production of German operas, except a composer who could
      write them. Umlauf and some others who imitated him were not the men for
      such an undertaking. Gluck had composed nothing since his "Iphigenia in
      Taurus," and contented himself with putting on the stage, in 1780, "Die
      Pilgrimme von Mekka," a comic opera which had been written for Vienna with
      French words ("La Rencontre ImprÃ©vue") in 1764, and which was often played
      in its German adaptation.<a href="#linknote-240018"
      name="linknoteref-240018" id="linknoteref-240018"> 18 </a> In the
      following year, by the express command of the Emperor Joseph, Salieri
      wrote a German comic opera, "Der Rauchfangkehrer"<a href="#linknote-240019"
      name="linknoteref-240019" id="linknoteref-240019"> 19 </a> ("The
      Chimney-Sweep"), the text of which, by Dr. Auembrugger, was unusually bad;<a

      OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p193.png">[193]</a></span>
      much effect on German opera. The operetta was assiduously cultivated in
      North Germany, and a long list of those which were produced might be
      given. But the contrast between North and South Germany, founded on their
      political and religious differences, was visible unpleasantly enough in
      literature and art, and had a marked influence on their musical sympathies

      show no signs of study in the Italian school of music, through which alone

      There was little demand in Vienna, therefore, for the compositions which
      Hiller's successful enterprise with German opera had brought into being;
      the works of men such as Benda, Schweitzer, Wolf, Neefe, AndrÃ©, and
      Reichard; their operas were not performed, and still less was there any
      prospect of a field for their future labours in Vienna. Schweitzer was not
      summoned, in spite of Wieland's pressing recommendation (Vol. I., p. 406).
      G. Benda had shown himself not disinclined to remove to Vienna,<a
      href="#linknote-240024" name="linknoteref-240024" id="linknoteref-240024">
      24 </a> and report had pointed to him as probable kapellmeister in 1778,<a
      href="#linknote-240025" name="linknoteref-240025" id="linknoteref-240025">
      25 </a> but he had never been seriously thought of. It appeared,
      therefore, that a most fitting career stood open for Mozart, and he
      himself wished nothing more than to prove his powers in this branch of his
      art. He had brought with him his operetta <span class="side">FIRST
      ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p194.png">[194]</a></span> "Zaide," in the hope of having
      it performed. The libretto, as he had feared, proved a stumbling-block
      (Vol. II.,p. 115); but the younger Stephanie, at that time inspector of
      the opera, formed so favourable an opinion of the music, that he promised
      to give Mozart a new and good piece, which he was to compose for the
      Vienna stage. His father warned him that Stephanie was not to be depended
      upon; and he was right. Stephanie the younger was an arrogant, selfish
      man, who had made himself hated everywhere by his intrigues and
      pretensions. Mozart knew that he was in ill repute, and was upon his
      guard. He resolved to write no opera without the express commission of
      Count Rosenberg, who had had supreme direction of the theatre since 1776;
      but Stephanie continued friendly, and there seemed no actual cause for
      personal distrust. Count Rosenberg had received Mozart well whenever he
      had waited upon him, and had joined in the applause of other connoisseurs
      upon the occasion of the performance of "Idomeneo" at the house of
      Countess Thun, Van Swieten and Sonnenfels being also among the audience.
      It was not long, therefore, before Mozart was able to announce to his
      father the good news (June 9, 1781) that Count Rosenberg had commissioned
      Schroder, the distinguished actor, to look out a good libretto, which was
      to be given to Mozart for composition. A few days afterwards Stephanie
      told him of a piece he had found in four acts, of which the first was
      excellent, but the others fell off, so that it was doubtful whether
      Schroder would undertake the adaptation of it. "They may settle that
      between them," wrote Wolfgang (June 16, 1781). The book was rejected, but
      the matter did not rest; the Emperor was evidently anxious to give Mozart
      an opportunity of trying his powers as a German operatic composer; and at
      the end of July the latter found himself at the goal of his wishes, and
      able to inform his father (August 1, 1781):&mdash;

      Yesterday young Stephanie gave me a book for composition. It is very good;
      the subject is Turkish, and it is called "Belmont und Constance," or "Die
      EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail." The overture, the chorus in the first act, and
      the concluding chorus I shall compose in Turkish music. Mdlle. Cavalieri,
      Mdlle. Teyber, M. Fischer, <span class="side">THE "ENTFÃœHRUNG.</span>

      Adamberger, M. pauer, and M. Walter are to sing in the opera. I am so
      delighted at having it to compose that the first songs for Cavalieri and
      Adamberger and the terzet at the close of the first act are already
      finished. The time given is short, certainly, for it is to be performed in
      the middle of September, but the attendant circumstances will be all the
      more favourable. And indeed everything combines to raise my spirits, so
      that I hasten to my writing-table with the greatest eagerness, and it is
      with difficulty I tear myself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourable circumstances which made Mozart so hopeful chiefly
      consisted in the expected visit of the Grand Duke Paul and his wife; the
      opera was to be among the festivities given in their honour, and it was
      safely to be expected that the Emperor and Count Rosenberg would consider
      it to his credit if he prepared the work in such haste for them; but all
      this was to be a secret. It was now very convenient to him to be in a
      house with good friends who would provide him with dinner and supper, and
      so enable him to sit writing all day. "You know of old how hungry I get
      when I am composing." He continued in this whirl of excitement, and was
      able to write on August 8:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just finished the chorus of Janizaries. Adamberger, Cavalieri, and
      Fischer are thoroughly pleased with their songs. I let the Countess Thun
      hear as much as is ready. She told me afterwards that she was ready to
      stake her life on it that what I had written so far would please. On this
      point, however, I listen to no man's praise or blame before the whole has
      been heard or seen, but I follow entirely my own feelings&mdash;only you
      may see from it how greatly she was pleased with the music herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 22 he wrote that the first act was finished; soon after he
      learnt, to his relief, that the Grand Duke was not coming until November,
      so that he could write his opera "with greater deliberation" (September 5,
      1781). Shortly afterwards he informs his father (September 26, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act was ready three weeks ago, and an aria in the second act and
      the drinking duet, which consists of nothing but my Turkish tattoo; but I
      cannot do any more at present, the whole thing being upset, and by my own
      desire. At the beginning of the third act there is a charming quintet, or
      rather finale, and this I mean to transfer to the end of the second act.
      But it will necessitate considerable alterations and the introduction of a
      fresh intrigue, and Stephanie is over head and ears in work.

      Another circumstance also interfered with the completion of Mozart's
      opera. It was proposed in honour of the distinguished visitors to perform
      two of Gluck's operas, viz.: "Iphigenia" in a German adaptation, and
      "Alceste" in Italian, "in order," as a contemporary announcement puts it,
      "to show what we Germans are able to accomplish."<a href="#linknote-240026"
      name="linknoteref-240026" id="linknoteref-240026"> 26 </a> Certainly the
      choice was well made with this object in view, although it was said in
      Vienna, as Mozart wrote to his father (August 29,1781), that it had been
      difficult to persuade the Emperor into it, for he was at heart as little
      partial to Gluck as to Gluck's favourite singer, Bernasconi.<a
      href="#linknote-240027" name="linknoteref-240027" id="linknoteref-240027">
      27 </a> The projected performance of these operas disturbed all Mozart's
      calculations. The applause which had been bestowed on his "Idomeneo" by
      capable and influential judges, and the readiness of the singers to appear
      in it, had raised the hope of producing it on this occasion in a German
      adaptation, which would have involved alterations in the composition; but
      a third grand opera would have been too much, and it could not have been
      studied together with Gluck's. Even the comic opera had to be temporarily
      laid aside until Gluck's two operas were ready&mdash;"and there is plenty
      of study to be got through still," he wrote to his father (October 6,
      1781). He was at work at it again in the middle of November; but the
      original intention of having it completed by the arrival of the Grand Duke
      was no longer feasible. On November 21 "that grand animal, the Grand
      Duke," arrived under the name of Count von Narden, and on the 25th a
      brilliant festival was given at Schonbrunn. "Tomorrow 'Alceste' is given
      at Schonbrunn,"<a href="#linknote-240028" name="linknoteref-240028"
      id="linknoteref-240028"> 28 </a> writes Mozart, <span class="side">ARCHDUKE
      MAXIMILIAN.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p197.png">[197]</a></span>
      sorrowfully (November 24, 1781). "I have been looking up Russian popular
      songs, in order to play variations on them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly before the arrival of the Grand Duke, the Duke of WÃ¼rtemberg, with
      his consort, the Princess Elizabeth, intended bride of the Archduke Franz,
      and her brother, Prince Ferdinand, had entered Vienna. "The Duke is a
      charming man, and the Duchess and Princess also; but the Prince is an
      octogenarian stick, and a real blockhead," was Mozart's concise
      description (November 17, 1781); but the arrival of the trio opened a
      favourable prospect for him. The Princess, who had come to have the
      finishing touches put to her education in Vienna, required a teacher of
      music, and this position, which, besides making a welcome addition to his
      income, would bring him into contact with very influential persons, Mozart
      hoped to obtain. His chief supporter was the Emperor's youngest brother,
      the Archduke Maximilian, at that time Coadjutor of the Elector of Cologne.
      The Archduke was musical, and had an excellent band of wind instruments in
      his pay;<a href="#linknote-240029" name="linknoteref-240029"
      id="linknoteref-240029"> 29 </a> he had a favourable remembrance of Mozart
      from his visit to Salzburg in 1775, and proved a very warm patron. Mozart
      wrote to his father (November 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday at three o'clock I was summoned by the Archduke. When I went in
      he was standing in the first room by the stove, and he came straight up to
      me and asked if I had anything to do to-day? "No, your royal highness,
      nothing at all; but even were it otherwise, I should be delighted to place
      my time at the disposal of your Royal Highness." "No, no; I do not want to
      disturb anybody." Then he said that he had a mind to give a concert in the
      evening at the WÃ¼rtemberg court, and would like me to play something and
      to accompany the songs; I was to go to him again at six o'clock. I played
      there last evening accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, Mozart could not conceal from himself that the Archduke
      had changed very much to his disadvantage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he was a priest he was much wittier and more intellectual, and
      spoke less but more sensibly. You should see him now! Stupidity stares out
      of his eyes, he talks and chatters without stopping, and all in a sort of
      falsetto voice; he has a swollen neck; in short, the whole man is
      transformed!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p198.png">[198]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he continued to patronise Mozart, drew him out on every
      occasion, and if he had only been Elector of Cologne, Mozart would have
      been kapellmeister by this time, as he told his father. He had used his
      influence with the Princess to take Mozart as her music-master, but
      received for answer that if it depended on herself she would certainly
      have chosen him, but the Emperor&mdash;"he cares for no one but Salieri,"
      cries Mozart in disgust&mdash;had recommended Salieri to her on account of
      his singing, and she felt obliged to engage him, to her great regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite true that Salieri stood high in the favour of Joseph II. He
      had been pupil of the Emperor's special favourite Gassmann, and had in a
      sense grown up under the royal eye;<a href="#linknote-240030"
      name="linknoteref-240030" id="linknoteref-240030"> 30 </a> he was
      regularly engaged at the imperial private concerts, and retained
      possession of his patron's favour by means both of his music and his
      personal demeanour. It was plain, therefore, that the preference for
      Salieri shown by the Emperor on this occasion did not arise from any
      ill-will towards Mozart; he was in close personal intercourse with
      Salieri, and esteemed him highly as a vocal composer, while Mozart was
      only known to him as a clavier-player. As such he had great admiration for
      him, and Mozart informed his father (December 26, 1781) that the Emperor
      had lately "passed the greatest <i>Ã©loge</i> on him in the words 'C'est un
      talent dÃ©cidÃ©.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had also (on December 14) commanded Mozart to play at court, and had
      arranged for him a contest of skill with Clementi, who had come to Vienna
      with the reputation of a clavier-player of unheard-of excellence. Clementi
      relates the encounter to his pupil L. Berger:<a href="#linknote-240031"
      name="linknoteref-240031" id="linknoteref-240031"> 31 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only been a few days in Vienna when I received an invitation to play
      before the Emperor on the pianoforte. On entering the music-room I beheld
      an individual whose elegant attire led me to mistake him for an imperial
      valet-de-chambre. But we had no sooner entered into conversation than it
      turned on musical topics, and we soon recognised in each other with
      sincere pleasure brother artists&mdash;Mozart and Clementi.

    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AND CLEMENTI, 1781.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p199.png">[199]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart continues the description of the scene (January 16, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had paid each other all manner of compliments, the Emperor gave
      the signal that Clementi should begin. "La santa chiesa cattoÃ¼ca!" said
      the Emperor&mdash;Clementi being a native of Rome. He preluded, and played
      a sonata.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is worthy of note here," says Berger, "that Clementi was peculiarly
      fond of extemporising long and very interesting and elaborate interludes
      and cadenzas in the pauses of his sonatas; it was this propensity which
      led him to select a sonata for performance which lent itself easily to
      such treatment, although in every other respect this sonata stands behind
      his earlier compositions of the same kind. It was the following&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      and we have perhaps to thank this subject for the allegro in the overture
      to the 'Zauberflote,' a composition never surpassed of its kind: <a
      href="#linknote-240032" name="linknoteref-240032" id="linknoteref-240032">
      32 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor then said to me: "Allons, d'rauf los!" ("Now then, fire
      away!") I preluded, and played some variations. Then the Grand Duchess<a
      href="#linknote-240033" name="linknoteref-240033" id="linknoteref-240033">
      33 </a> produced some sonatas by Paesiello (in his own miserable
      manuscript),<a href="#linknote-240034" name="linknoteref-240034"
      id="linknoteref-240034"> 34 </a> of which I was to play the allegro and
      Clementi the andante and rondo. Then we each took a subject and carried it
      out on two pianofortes. By the way, I had borrowed the Countess Thun's
      pianoforte for myself, but only played upon it when I played alone. The
      Emperor wished it to be so. The other instrument was out of tune, and had
      three of its keys sticking. "Never mind," said the Emperor. I look upon it
      that the Emperor knows my musical powers and knowledge, and wishes to do
      me justice in the eyes of the foreigners. I know upon very good authority
      that he was thoroughly satisfied with me.

      Dittersdorf confirms this view, and extracts the following from a
      conversation with Joseph II.:<a href="#linknote-240035"

      <i>Emperor</i>: "Have you heard Mozart?" <i>Myself</i>: "Three times
      already." <i>Emperor</i>: "How do you like him?" <i>Myself</i>: "As every
      connoisseur <i>must</i> like him." <i>Emperor</i>: "Have you heard
      Clementi also?" <i>Myself</i>: "I have heard him also." <i>Emperor</i>:
      "Some people prefer him to Mozart, which makes Greybig wild. What is your
      opinion? speak out." <i>Myself</i>: "In Clementi's playing there is merely
      art, but in Mozart's both art and taste." <i>Emperor</i>: "That is just
      what I said myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the competition, the Emperor sent Mozart fifty ducats, "which were
      very acceptable at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clementi was delighted with Mozart's playing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never heard so delicate and graceful an execution. I was especially
      delighted with an adagio, and with several of his extemporised variations.
      The Emperor gave the subject, and we varied it, alternately accompanying
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Mozart's judgment of Clementi was sharp and severe:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clementi is a good player, and that is all one can say. He plays well as
      far as the execution of his right hand is concerned. His forte lies in
      passages in thirds. But he has not an atom of taste or feeling, in fact he
      is a mere mechanist.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his sister in Salzburg had made acquaintance with Clementi's sonatas,
      he wrote to her (June 7, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I must say a word to my sister on the subject of Clementi's sonatas.
      Every one who plays them must be aware that as compositions they are
      valueless. There are no striking passages, except the sixths and octaves,
      and I should strongly advise you not to be too much taken with these, for
      they are the ruin of a firm and quiet hand, and would soon deprive it of
      its lightness, flexibility, and flowing rapidity. For what is the object
      of these passages after all? They must be executed with the utmost
      rapidity (which not even Clementi himself can accomplish), and a
      lamentable hash is the result&mdash;nothing else in the world, Clementi is
      a charlatan, <i>like all the Italians!</i> He writes <i>presto</i> on a
      sonata, or even <i>prestissimo or alia breve</i>, and plays it <i>allegro</i>
      in three-four time. I have heard him do it! What he does <span class="side">STRACK
      AND COURT MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p201.png">[201]</a></span>
      really well are passages in thirds&mdash;he worked at them day and night
      in London&mdash;but he can do nothing else, and he has not the least
      execution or taste, and far less any sentiment in his playing.<a
      href="#linknote-240036" name="linknoteref-240036" id="linknoteref-240036">
      36 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In justification of this censure, Berger mentions Clementi having told him
      that, at the time of which Mozart writes, he devoted his attention to
      brilliant execution, and in particular to double runs and extemporised
      passages; it was only later that he adopted a more expressive style, which
      was perfected by the study of the best vocal music of the day, and by the
      gradual improvements made in the instrument known as the English
      pianoforte, the primitive construction of which had been too defective to
      allow of an expressive legato execution. Berger remarks further that
      Mozart's honourable and upright character prevents any suspicion of
      underhand motives for the severity of his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart sought to gain favour with the Emperor by securing the support of
      his groom of the chamber, Strack, who possessed great influence in musical
      affairs. He tells his father (November 3, 1781) that on his name-day
      (October 31), which he had celebrated at the house of Baroness
      WaldstÃ¤tten, he had been surprised by a serenade of his own composition
      (375 K.), which he had composed on St. Theresa's day (October 15) for the
      daughter-in-law of the court painter, Hickl. "The chief reason I wrote
      it," he continues, "was to let Herr von Strack, who goes there almost
      daily, hear something of mine, and I made it somewhat serious accordingly;
      it was very much admired." He ventured at a later date to count upon
      Strack as his friend with the Emperor, although, as he cautiously adds,
      "the courtier is never to be trusted" (January 23, 1782). The report
      having reached Salzburg that the Emperor intended taking Mozart into his
      service, he answers his father (April 10, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that I have not written to you about it is because I know
      nothing of it myself. It is certain, however, that the whole town is full
      of it, and that I am congratulated on all sides; I would fain believe,
      too, that the Emperor has been spoken to on the subject, and <span
      class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p202.png">[202]</a></span> has it in his mind, but so far I
      have not heard a word. It has gone so far that the Emperor is thinking of
      it, and that without my having moved a step in the matter. I have been
      sundry times to see Herr von Strack (who is on my side) both to keep him
      in mind of me, and because
    </p>
    <p>
      I like him; but not often enough to be tiresome or to appear to have any
      motive in it; and he must acknowledge as an honest man that he has not
      heard a word from me which could give him occasion to say that I wished to
      remain, far less to be engaged by the Emperor. We talk of nothing but
      music. It is of his own free will and quite disinterestedly that he speaks
      of me to the Emperor. Since it has gone so far without my co-operation, it
      may come to something. If one appears anxious, there is less chance of a
      good salary, for the Emperor is certainly a niggard. If he wants to have
      me, he must pay me for it; for the honour of being in the Emperor's
      service does not go very far with me.

      Joseph II. was accustomed to have a concert in his own apartments every
      afternoon.<a href="#linknote-240037" name="linknoteref-240037"
      id="linknoteref-240037"> 37 </a> He generally dined alone in the
      music-room, which did not usually occupy more than a quarter of an hour;
      if there was no important business to be transacted, the concert began as
      soon as the cloth was removed, and lasted for about an hour, so that the
      Emperor might visit the theatre. Three times a week there was a grand
      concert, at which Gassmann,<a href="#linknote-240038"
      name="linknoteref-240038" id="linknoteref-240038"> 38 </a> and later
      Salieri, or sometimes Umlauf, were expected to appear; there was no
      audience, and the Archduke Maximilian, when he was present, took an active
      part in the performance. Joseph II. possessed a thorough musical
      education,<a href="#linknote-240039" name="linknoteref-240039"
      id="linknoteref-240039"> 39 </a> and preferred the severe style (Vol. I.,
      p. 368); his fine bass voice had been trained in the Italian school,<a
      href="#linknote-240040" name="linknoteref-240040" id="linknoteref-240040">
      40 </a> and he played the violoncello and viola, as well as the clavier;
      he also read both vocal and instrumental music with great facility, and
      was a skilful player from score. Usually separate pieces were selected
      from operas and, oratorios; the Emperor accompanied from the score on the
      clavier, and also took a tenor or bass part&mdash;a pathetic one by
      preference.<a href="#linknote-240041" name="linknoteref-240041"
      id="linknoteref-240041"> 41 </a> The pieces chosen were <span class="side">KREIBICH
      AND THE ORCHESTRA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p203.png">[203]</a></span>
      sometimes old favourites of the Emperor, sometimes new works with which he
      thus became acquainted; the operas which were afterwards to be performed
      were generally gone through in this way by the Emperor and the Archduke
      Maximilian.<a href="#linknote-240042" name="linknoteref-240042"
      id="linknoteref-240042"> 42 </a> The pieces were generally played and sung
      at sight; it amused the Emperor to put the executants on their trial, and
      he was delighted at the confusion which often ensued; the more energetic
      and distracted the conductor Kreibich became, the more heartily the
      Emperor laughed.<a href="#linknote-240043" name="linknoteref-240043"
      id="linknoteref-240043"> 43 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the ordinary concerts the Emperor only took part in the quartet. The
      first violin was played by Kreibich (or Greybig), "a man who was made for
      a conductor; he has a capital insight into the theory of music, but,
      unfortunately for his art, affects a certain degree of charlatanry. His
      timidity prevents his executing solo parts with distinctness and elegance,
      and his bowing is not sufficiently round and firm." This nervousness,
      joined to a pompous manner, made him the butt of the jokes and squibs of
      the musical circle,<a href="#linknote-240044" name="linknoteref-240044"
      id="linknoteref-240044"> 44 </a> and though not at all ill-natured, he was
      not in a position to make his opinion of value, but allowed himself to be
      made the tool of others, who were willing enough to let him appear to the
      Emperor and the public as the leader of all that related to the chamber
      music. With him were associated the violinists Woborzil, who led the
      orchestra in the German opera, Hoffmann, Ponheim, and Krottendorfer,
      mediocre artists and unimportant men; of the last it was only said that he
      flattered Strack, and was his marionette. Strack was in fact the soul of
      these concerts; he had the direction of the musicians, played the
      violoncello, and was present on every occasion, while the others took it
      by turns; this, together with his personal position, gave him overpowering
      influence with the Emperor. "You know the kind of men <span class="side">FIRST
      ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p204.png">[204]</a></span> who, as Schiller says, come in
      as makeshifts when any one is wanted. Strack has always been with Joseph,
      and has used his opportunities so well that, in the musical line, he can
      do exactly as he likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fact that good music, especially good instrumental music, was
      seldom performed in the closet. If a quartet was played it was by a
      second-rate composer, and the masters who were then founding a new epoch
      in this province, Haydn&mdash;for whose "tricks" the Emperor did not care
      much<a href="#linknote-240045" name="linknoteref-240045"
      id="linknoteref-240045"> 45 </a>&mdash;and Mozart, together with their
      imitators, Pleyel and Kozeluch, were excluded, or as good as excluded.
      This was considered to be owing to Strack's influence, and it was wondered
      at that Salieri, "the idol of the Emperor," who invariably took part in
      the private concerts, did not assert his opinion; but he "was too politic
      to come into collision with the shadow of his Emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      How far, after all, was Salieri capable of influencing the music of his
      day? Joseph's taste had been formed on the tradition of Italian music,
      represented by Hasse and Piccinni, and his predilections retained the same
      direction. His wish to develop a national school of music proceeded from
      rational conviction; and, though he was intellectually capable of
      appreciating the works of Gluck and Mozart, they were not really after his
      own heart. He had avowedly accustomed himself to look for entertainment in
      music, and was overpowered by the independent power and fulness which
      Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart brought to bear upon their art. Salieri had no
      reason for combating the Emperor's inclinations, since they were also his
      own. He skilfully sought to turn to account the acquisitions which music
      had made in various directions, and to make Italian opera capable of
      satisfying the demands of a more enlightened taste. With the exception of
      the operas written for Paris, in which he consciously followed Gluck's
      manner, he remained throughout true to the tradition of Italian opera,
      introduced no new element into it, and did not possess <span class="side">SALIERI
      AND MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p205.png">[205]</a></span>
      originality enough to make an indelible mark on the music of the day. But
      it was just this mediocrity of talent, skill, and taste which won for him
      the favour of his imperial master and of the public; it would have
      required the possession of a singular union of moral and artistic
      greatness and magnanimity to acknowledge rising genius as superior to his
      own, and to bow himself down before it&mdash;and Salieri was not capable
      of this. He is described as a benevolent and good-tempered man, amiable in
      his private life, and adorned with the well-deserved fame of noble and
      generous actions;<a href="#linknote-240046" name="linknoteref-240046"
      id="linknoteref-240046"> 46 </a> but these good qualities did not preserve
      from envy either his reputation or his position. In the year 1780 he had
      just returned from a lengthened tour in Italy, which had brought him new
      fame and honour, and had confirmed him in the favour of the Emperor; at
      this point Mozart made his appearance as a rival, dangerous by reason of
      his brilliant powers of execution, which most readily win the applause of
      the multitude, as well as by his compositions. The "EntfÃ¼hrung"
      threatening to throw Salieri's "Rauch-fangkehrer" completely into the
      shade, and "Idomeneo" establishing its composer as a formidable competitor
      on his own ground, it was impossible that Salieri, who instinctively felt
      Mozart's superiority, could long pretend indifference to it. There was no
      interruption of their personal intercourse.<a href="#linknote-240047"
      name="linknoteref-240047" id="linknoteref-240047"> 47 </a> Mozart was
      friendly and unconstrained in his behaviour to his fellow-artists, "even
      to Salieri, who could not bear him," as Frau Sophie Haibl, Mozart's
      sister-in-law, relates, and Salieri was "too politic" to make any show of
      his dislike to Mozart. It was understood in Vienna, however, that he did
      dislike him, and that he secretly strove to check his progress, not only
      by depreciatory criticism,<a href="#linknote-240048"
      name="linknoteref-240048" id="linknoteref-240048"> 48 </a> but by every
      <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p206.png">[206]</a></span> sort of obstacle thrown in his
      way from the very first. Salieri had been appointed maestro to the
      Princess Elizabeth, but he was unable to instruct her on the clavier, and
      Mozart had clearly the next claim. "He may take the trouble," writes he to
      his father (August 31, 1782), "to do me harm in this matter, but the
      Emperor knows me; the princess would have liked to learn from me from the
      first, and I know that my name stands in the book where the list of all
      those appointed to her service is kept." But Salieri was much too cautious
      to allow Mozart to attain to such a position. An unknown musician named
      Summerer was appointed teacher of the clavier to the Princess Elizabeth.
      Mozart consoled himself, when he heard that the salary was only four
      hundred florins, by the reflection that it would not leave much over when
      the waiting, travelling, and other expenses contingent on such a service
      had been paid for (October 12, 1782).
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances Salieri and Strack were naturally sworn allies
      in the Emperor's music room, and resisted together the introduction of any
      elements which would undermine their influence by giving the Emperor's
      taste a new direction. Although, therefore, Mozart was encouraged by the
      Emperor's expressions of liking for him, more especially as "great rulers
      are not too fond of saying such things for fear of a dagger-thrust from an
      envious rival," yet the obstacles which he had to overcome in the
      surroundings of the Emperor were likely to prove too powerful for him. The
      Emperor's parsimony also restrained him from adding another kapellmeister
      to those who were already in receipt of salaries from the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another chance of such a fixed situation as his father was continually
      urging upon him to secure offered itself through Prince Aloys
      Liechtenstein, the eldest son of the reigning prince, whose income was
      estimated at 900,000 imperial <span class="side">CONCERTS, LESSONS, AND
      COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p207.png">[207]</a></span>
      gulden.<a href="#linknote-240049" name="linknoteref-240049"
      id="linknoteref-240049"> 49 </a> He proposed enrolling a band of wind
      instruments in his service, and wished to engage Mozart to arrange pieces
      for it. For this he could not expect a high salary, but it would be a
      certain one, for he had quite resolved to accept none but a permanent
      engagement. But this hope, too, was disappointed,<a href="#linknote-240050"
      name="linknoteref-240050" id="linknoteref-240050"> 50 </a> and he
      continued to exist on the uncertain proceeds of lessons, concerts, and
      composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of affairs improved somewhat in the winter. He had constant
      pupils in the Countess Rumbeck and Frau von Trattnem, to whom was added
      later the Countess Zichy. He gave each of them a lesson daily, and
      received six ducats for twelve, which sufficed for absolute necessities.
      Six sonatas for clavier and violin, for which his patronesses had opened a
      subscription of three ducats, were completed and printed in November,
      1781.<a href="#linknote-240051" name="linknoteref-240051"
      id="linknoteref-240051"> 51 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lent he gave a concert, at which, following the advice of his patrons,
      he played selections from "Idomeneo" and his concerto in D major (175 K.),
      for which he had composed a new rondo (382 K.). The rondo "made a great
      sensation," and was sent to Salzburg, with a request that it might be
      treasured as a jewel. "I wrote it especially for myself, and no one else
      shall play it except my dear sister" (March 2, 1782). As a conclusion he
      played a fantasia. He had been advised to do this because he would be
      thereby most certain of outrivalling Clementi, who was giving a concert at
      about the same time.<a href="#linknote-240052" name="linknoteref-240052"
      id="linknoteref-240052"> 52 </a> Mozart had plenty of invitations to play
      at other people's concerts and in society, on which occasions a new
      composition had generally to be written. At Auernhammer's concert, for
      instance, he played with the daughter a "sonata for two" (381 K.), which
      he <span class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p208.png">[208]</a></span> had composed
      on purpose, and which "was a great success" (November 24, 1781). He wrote
      easier pieces for his pupils. "I must close my letter" he writes (June 20,
      1781), "for I have to prepare some variations for a pupil"; and soon after
      he wrote to his sister (July 4, 1781): "I have written three airs with
      variations, which are not worth the trouble of sending alone. I will wait
      until there is something to accompany them."
    </p>
    <p>
      His time was fully occupied, therefore, and he had no difficulty in
      proving the injustice of his sister's reproaches to him for not writing
      oftener (February 13, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not conclude that you do not give me pleasure by writing to me
      because I do not always answer you. I always look forward with great
      pleasure to receiving a letter from you, my dear sister. If I were not
      prevented by pressing engagements, God knows I would always answer you. Is
      it true that I have never answered you? It certainly has not been from
      forgetfulness nor carelessness, but from simple impossibility! Bad enough,
      you will say, but do I write often, even to my father? You both know
      Vienna. You ought to know that a man who has no regular income must work
      day and night in such a city. Our father, when he has finished his church
      service, and you, when you have dismissed your few pupils, can do as you
      like all the rest of the day, and you may write letters long enough to
      contain the whole litany, if you like; but I can do no such thing. I gave
      my father a description of my mode of life a short time ago. I will repeat
      it for you now. At six o'clock my barber comes, at seven I am dressed, and
      write until nine. From nine o'clock till one I give lessons, then I dine,
      if I am not invited out, in which case we dine at two or even three
      o'clock, as we shall to-day and to-morrow at the Countess Zichy's and
      Countess Thun's. I cannot begin to work again till five or six o'clock,
      and am often even then prevented by a concert; if not, I write. The
      continual concerts, and the uncertainty as to whether I shall be called
      away here or there, prevent my writing in the evening; so it is my custom
      (especially when I come home early) to compose something before I go to
      bed. I often write on until one o'clock, and am up again at six! My
      dearest sister, if you really believe that I can forget you or my father,
      then&mdash;but no! God knows it, and that is enough for me; let Him punish
      me if I ever forget you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instances are not wanting of his affection and thought for his father and
      sister. He sends his father (March 23, 1782) a snuffbox and a pair of
      watch ribbons: "The snuffbox is a good one, and the picture on it is from
      an English story; <span class="side">PERFORMANCE OF THE "ENTFÃœHRUNG,"
      JULY, 1782.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p209.png">[209]</a></span>
      the watch ribbons are not very valuable, but they are high fashion here
      just now." He did not buy either of them, he adds for his father's
      consolation, but was presented with them by Count Szapary. To his sister
      also he sent different bits of finery, and begged her to intrust him with
      any commission in Vienna; he also testified the warmest sympathy in her
      love affairs. He did not forget his old Salzburg friends in Vienna&mdash;begs
      for news of them from his sister, "the walking register of Salzburg," and
      wished still to be considered as an active member of the quoit club.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these manifold occupations the opera had still the first place in
      his thoughts, but it was at a standstill owing to the production of
      Gluck's two operas and the numerous alterations which were necessary in
      the libretto; he hoped that it would be ready for representation, however,
      directly after Easter. This was not the case, but on May 8 he writes:
      "Yesterday I was with the Countess Thun, and ran over the second act for
      her; she is as pleased with it as she was with the first"; and on May 29:
      "Next Monday is to be the first rehearsal; I must admit that I am
      delighted with this opera."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had good cause to be so, for its ultimate success was assured. But
      he had to fight against strong cabals, and it needed the express command
      of the Emperor to bring the opera to performance on July 13. High as had
      been the expectations of the public, they were fully justified by the
      result. "The house was crammed full, there was no end to the applause and
      cheering, and performances followed one another in quick succession."<a
      href="#linknote-240053" name="linknoteref-240053" id="linknoteref-240053">
      53 </a> After having given his father a short account of the first
      performance, he reports more fully on the second (July 20, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday my opera was given for the second time. Can you believe that the
      opposition was even stronger than on the first evening? The whole of the
      first act was drowned, but they could not prevent the bravos after every
      song. My hope was in the closing terzet, but <span class="side">FIRST
      ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p210.png">[210]</a></span> Fischer had been rendered
      nervous, and went wrong, as did Dauer, and Adamberger alone could not put
      things right; so that the whole effect was lost; and this time it was not
      encored. I was beside myself with rage, and so was Adamberger; we agreed
      that the opera should not be given again without a rehearsal for the
      singers. In the second act the two duets were encored, and also Belmonte's
      rondo, "Wenn der Freude Thranen fliessen," &amp;c. The theatre was almost
      more crowded than on the first performance; the day before not a seat was
      to be had either on the <i>noble parterre</i> or in the third story, and
      not a single box. The opera has brought twelve hundred florins in the two
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next letter (July 27, 1782), he continues:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My opera was given yesterday (St. Ann's day) in honour of all Nannerls,
      for the third time, and the theatre, in spite of the stifling heat, was
      again crammed full. It was to have been played again next Friday, but I
      have protested, for I do not want it to be run to death. People are quite
      foolish about the opera, I must say. But it does one good to receive such
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this, it was given again on July 30, and also on the
      Friday, and the theatre "swarmed with people in every part."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart was busily employed in arranging his opera for harmony (wind)
      music, when he received a commission from the Haffner family in Salzburg
      (Vol. I., p. 153) to compose a new serenata. L. Mozart had first been
      applied to, and he thought it becoming that Wolfgang should lighten his
      father's labours by undertaking a work which cost him no exertion, and
      would be of direct advantage to his father. He therefore begged him to
      write a serenata without delay, for the time was approaching when it was
      to be performed. Wolfgang was quite ready to consent, inconvenient as it
      might be to him (July 20, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have certainly enough to do, for by Sunday week my opera must be
      arranged for wind instruments, or some one else will get the start of me,
      and reap the profit; and now I have to write a new symphony! I hardly see
      how it will be possible. You would not believe how difficult it is to
      arrange a work like this for harmony, so that it may preserve its effects,
      and yet be suitable for wind instruments. Well, I must give up my nights
      to it, for it cannot be done any other way; and to you, my dear father,
      they shall be devoted. You shall certainly receive something every
      post-day, and I will work as quickly as I can, and as well as I can
      compatibly with such haste.

      He kept his word, although not quite so soon as he himself wished. In his
      next letter he writes (July 27, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You will make a wry face when you see only the first allegro; but it could
      not be helped, for I was called upon to compose a serenade in great haste&mdash;but
      only for wind instruments, or else I could have used it for you. On
      Wednesday, the 31st, I will send the two minuets, the andante, and the
      last movement: if I can I will send a march also; if not, you must take
      that belonging to the Haffner music, which is very little known (249 K.).
      I have written it in D, because you prefer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the serenata was not ready within the next few days, for he says in
      his letter of July 31:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You see that my will is good, but if one cannot do a thing&mdash;why one
      cannot! I cannot slur over anything, so it will be next post-day before I
      can send you the whole symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he wrote (August 7, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herewith I send you a short march (probably 445 K.). I hope all will
      arrive in good time, and that you will find it to your taste. The first
      allegro must be fiery, and the last as quick as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months later, when he had this symphony sent back to him for
      performance at one of his concerts, he wrote to his father (February
      15,1783): "The new Haffner symphony has quite astonished me, for I did not
      remember a word of it, and it must be very effective." These little
      incidents show us the true Mozart, in his good-nature and readiness to
      oblige his father, and in his power of productiveness and elasticity of
      mind; he excuses himself for not having the symphony ready in a fortnight&mdash;and
      that at a time when not only his opera, but also his courtship and
      marriage were filling his head and his heart&mdash;and then he is
      astonished at himself for having done the thing so well.<a
      href="#linknote-240054" name="linknoteref-240054" id="linknoteref-240054">
      54 </a> The serenata which was thus composed is the lovely one in C minor
      (388 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the opera pursued its successful course; in the <span
      class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p212.png">[212]</a></span> course of the year it was
      performed sixteen times; and in the beginning of October, when the
      Archduke and his wife returned to Vienna, on their homeward journey, the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung" was given in their honour, "on which occasion I thought it as
      well to sit at the piano again and conduct," he writes to his father
      (October 19, 1782), "partly to wake up the somewhat slumbering energies of
      the orchestra, partly to show the great people present that I am the
      father of my offspring." Kaiser Joseph had attained the object of his
      ambition; the German opera was established; but he scarcely seemed to
      appreciate the importance of the movement thus set on foot. His criticism
      on the "EntfÃ¼hrung"&mdash;"Too fine for our ears, and an immense number of
      notes, my dear Mozart!" (referring, no doubt, to the accompaniment, which
      was also found fault with by Dittersdorf as overpowering the voices)<a
      href="#linknote-240055" name="linknoteref-240055" id="linknoteref-240055">
      55 </a>&mdash;is indicative of his taste. Mozart's spirited answer, "Just
      as many notes, your majesty, as are necessary," was worthy of an artist.<a
      href="#linknote-240056" name="linknoteref-240056" id="linknoteref-240056">
      56 </a> Generally speaking, the opera received unmitigated praise. Prince
      Kaunitz, an accomplished amateur and passionate friend of the theatre,<a
      href="#linknote-240057" name="linknoteref-240057" id="linknoteref-240057">
      57 </a> sent for the young composer, received him in the most flattering
      manner, and remained henceforth his friend and patron. The veteran Gluck,
      the most distinguished person in the musical world, expressed a desire to
      hear the opera which was making so much sensation; it was performed at his
      request, as Mozart writes to his father (August 7, 1782), although it had
      been given only a few days before; he paid the composer many compliments
      on it, and invited him to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera had decided Mozart's musical position in Vienna;<a
      href="#linknote-240058" name="linknoteref-240058" id="linknoteref-240058">
      58 </a> it speedily caused his fame to spread throughout Germany. The
      Prussian minister, Baron Riedesel&mdash;the <span class="side">SUCCESS OF
      THE ENTFÃœHRUNG.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p213.png">[213]</a></span>
      well-known traveller and friend of Winckelmann&mdash;begged Mozart for a
      copy of the score for performance in Berlin, for which he was to receive
      suitable remuneration. This was the more flattering, since AndrÃ©'s version
      of the "EntfÃ¼hrung" had been well received in Berlin only the year before.
      Mozart had sent the original score to his father immediately after the
      first performance, that he might become acquainted with the composition
      before seeing the opera, which he was not to do until the end of 1784, in
      Salzburg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just promised to have it copied. As I have not got the opera I am
      obliged to borrow it from the copyist, which is very inconvenient, since I
      never can keep it three days together; the Emperor continually sends for
      it, as he did yesterday, and it is so often performed; it has been
      performed ten times since August 16. My idea was, therefore, to have it
      copied in Salzburg, where it can be done more secretly and cheaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, who watched his son's proceedings with jealousy and suspicion,
      thought he detected something underhand in the objection to have the
      copying done in Vienna. He had reminded his son, <i>Ã¤ propos</i> of
      "Idomeneo," that the score should remain the property of the composer
      (Vol. II., p. 141); and he now cautioned him as to whether he had the
      right to dispose of the score, would it not cause unpleasantness in
      Vienna, and that for the sake of an uncertain verbal promise of payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Wolfgang answered (October 5, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited on the Baron von Riedesel myself; he is a charming man, and I
      promised him (in the belief that the opera was already in the hands of the
      copyist) that he should have it at the end of this month, or at the latest
      at the beginning of November. I must beg you to take care that I have it
      by that time. To relieve you of all anxiety, which I thankfully
      acknowledge as a proof of your fatherly love, I cannot say anything more
      convincing than that I am under great obligation to the Baron for having
      asked me for the opera, instead of going direct to the copyist (as is the
      custom in Italy), who would have given it to him directly for ready money;
      and besides this, I should have been very sorry if my talent could be paid
      for in that way&mdash;especially by a hundred ducats!<a
      href="#linknote-240059" name="linknoteref-240059" id="linknoteref-240059">
      59 </a> This time (because there is no occasion) I shall say nothing <span
      class="side">FIRST ATTEMPTS IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p214.png">[214]</a></span> about it; if it is performed, as
      it is certain to be (and that is what pleases me most about it), it will
      be known soon enough, and my enemies will have no excuse for ridiculing
      me, and treating me as a poor fellow: they will be quite ready to ask me
      for another opera if I will write it, but I do not know that I shall;
      certainly not if I am to be paid one hundred ducats, and see the theatre
      make four times that sum in a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall bring out my next opera at my own expense, make at least twelve
      hundred florins in three representations, and then the management may have
      it for fifty ducats. If not, I shall be paid, and can produce it anywhere.
      Meanwhile I hope you will never find in me the least trace of any evil
      intentions. I would fain not be a bad fellow, but I do not want to be a
      stupid one who lets other people reap the advantage of his labour and
      study, and gives up his rightful claim to his own works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father's distrustful prudence prevented his putting the work in hand
      at once, and such haste was then necessary that no copyist in Salzburg
      would undertake it; Mozart had no resource but to explain the cause of the
      delay to the ambassador. But in the end the score was copied in Salzburg.
      The "EntfÃ¼hrung" was performed the following year at Prague with
      extraordinary success.<a href="#linknote-240060" name="linknoteref-240060"
      id="linknoteref-240060"> 60 </a> "I cannot describe the applause and
      sensation which it excited at Vienna from my own observation," says
      Niemetschek; "but I was a witness of the enthusiasm with which it was
      received at Prague by connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs. It made what one
      had hitherto heard and known appear not to be music at all! Every one was
      transported&mdash;amazed at the novel harmonies, and at the original
      passages for the wind instruments." It was given at Leipzig in 1783;<a

      id="linknoteref-240065"> 65 </a> The applause was great on all occasions,
      and very soon the smaller stages sought to master the favourite piece. The
      actor Philipp Hasenhuth used to relate how the theatrical manager <span
      class="side">PERFORMANCES OF THE "ENTFÃœHRUNG".</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p215.png">[215]</a></span> Wilhelm, at Baden,<a
      href="#linknote-240066" name="linknoteref-240066" id="linknoteref-240066">
      66 </a> in 1783 or 1784, undertook the production of the "EntfÃ¼hrung" with
      a very weak company. At the rehearsal of the quartet there was no
      tenor-player; Hasenhuth, who had just begun to learn the violin, and
      hardly knew one string from another, was put down to the tenor. A little
      man who had come in as a spectator sat down by him, and when he saw the
      deficiency, seized a viola and they played together. But the little man
      soon showed his impatience of his stumbling neighbour, and giving vent to
      his anger more and more plainly as the quartet proceeded, he ended by
      flinging away the viola, exclaiming, "The man is a veritable donkey!" (Der
      Herr ist ein wahrer Krautesel!), and running out of the room. The opera,
      however, was a great success; and the well-satisfied manager gave his
      company a farewell supper, to which, hearing that Mozart was in Baden, he
      invited the composer. Hasenhuth was astonished to recognise in him the
      tenor-player at the rehearsal, but Mozart relieved him from all
      awkwardness by saying good-humouredly, "I was somewhat impolite when we
      last met, but I did not know who you were, and the devil himself could not
      have stood the wrong notes!" The judgment of contemporary critics of the
      opera was almost unanimously of accord with that of the public.<a
      href="#linknote-240067" name="linknoteref-240067" id="linknoteref-240067">
      67 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not probable that Mozart obtained any share of the rich profits
      which accrued from the production of his opera on these various stages. He
      was even cheated out of the production of a clavier score. "Now it has
      come to pass exactly as I foretold to my son," wrote L. Mozart to his
      daughter (December 16, 1785); "the 'EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail' has
      appeared in clavier score at Augsburg, and has also been printed at
      Mayence. Since March, when he began it, my son has not found time to
      finish it. He has lost his time, and Torricella (who was to publish it at
      Vienna) his profits."<a href="#linknote-240068" name="linknoteref-240068"

    </h2>
    <p>
      THE gradual decline of the German festival and "spektakel" operas was
      consummated in 1742, when Gottsched, <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS
      DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p216.png">[216]</a></span>
      who had waged incessant war against them throughout his career, had the
      satisfaction of chronicling the opera of "Atalanta," in Dresden, as the
      last of its kind<a href="#linknote-25001" name="linknoteref-25001"
      id="linknoteref-25001"> 1 </a> but they were succeeded by a sort of
      aftergrowth in the form of the operetta.<a href="#linknote-25002"
      name="linknoteref-25002" id="linknoteref-25002"> 2 </a> The theatrical
      managers could not altogether dispense with similar means of attraction,
      and attempts were made to introduce the musical intermezzo, together with
      the now fairly well-established ballet. In 1743 Schonemann produced in
      Berlin Coffey's "Devil to Pay" ("Der Teufel ist los"), adapted by Von
      Barck, with the English melodies;<a href="#linknote-25003"
      name="linknoteref-25003" id="linknoteref-25003"> 3 </a> but this attempt,
      as well as the performance of SchÃ¼rer's vaudeville "Doris," in Dresden, in
      1747,<a href="#linknote-25004" name="linknoteref-25004"
      id="linknoteref-25004"> 4 </a> remained without result. In 1752 Koch, of
      Leipzig, who had had recourse to the performance of Italian intermezzi,<a
      href="#linknote-25005" name="linknoteref-25005" id="linknoteref-25005"> 5
      </a> commissioned Chr. Fel. Weisse to make a new adaptation of Coffey's
      "Devil to Pay, or the Bewitched Wives," which was set to music by
      Standfuss, the assistant-manager of Koch's company.<a
      href="#linknote-25006" name="linknoteref-25006" id="linknoteref-25006"> 6

      the opera "Der Teufel ist los"&mdash;"Der Lustige Schuster"&mdash;was

      href="pgimages/p217.png">[217]</a></span> Leipzig, in 1765, did he give
      his serious attention to vaudeville. Weisse revised his old opera of "Der
      Teufel ist los," which, with partially new music by Hiller, was performed
      in 1766, and received with fresh applause.<a href="#linknote-25009"
      name="linknoteref-25009" id="linknoteref-25009"> 9 </a> Koch found in Joh.
      Ad. Hiller what had always hitherto been wanting, viz., a composer of good
      musical and general education, having a decided talent for light, easy,
      and characteristic music (more especially comic music), and full of zeal
      for the elevation of the national art. He endeavoured to make another step
      in advance, and by the composition of Schieb-ler's romantic poem of
      "Lisuart and Dariolette" (performed November 25, 1766) to lay the
      foundation of serious German opera.<a href="#linknote-250010"
      name="linknoteref-250010" id="linknoteref-250010"> 10 </a> Educated in the
      tradition of Hasse and Graun, with the additional influence of Ph. Em.
      Bach, he followed with interest the attempts to gain favour for Italian
      music in Paris by reconciling it with the demands of French taste; and he
      wished to establish a national German opera on the same principles. He
      denied that the German language was unfitted for song, if only the poet
      would take the trouble of accommodating it to the music, and if artists
      were trained for German singing with as much care as for Italian. Since
      German taste was more Italian than French, but the French were superior to
      the Italians in dramatic treatment, a French plan in Italian form was most
      likely to be approved of by Germans.<a href="#linknote-250011"
      name="linknoteref-250011" id="linknoteref-250011"> 11 </a> The
      insufficient appointments of the Leipzig stage must, however, have
      dissuaded him from any idea of a grand opera. To this was added his
      connection with Weisse, who during his residence in Paris had taken a
      lively interest in the comic opera, and had exerted himself to transplant
      it into Germany.<a href="#linknote-250012" name="linknoteref-250012"

      His first opera, "Lottchen am Hofe," after "Ninette Ã¤ la Cour," and "Die
      Liebe auf dem Lande," after "Annette et <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG
      AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p218.png">[218]</a></span>
      Lubin" and "La Clochette," had so great a success in 1767 and 1768 that
      they prepared the way for other similar attempts.<a href="#linknote-250013"
      name="linknoteref-250013" id="linknoteref-250013"> 13 </a> These simple
      dramas, which occupied the mind without exerting it, and moved the
      feelings without unduly exciting them, were so much in keeping with
      Weisse's own nature that he was able to give them characteristic and
      appropriate form. They opened a field, too, for Hiller's simple hearty
      spirit, embodied in a popular form, which made his style appeal at once to
      the multitude; while an endeavour after higher things would only have
      turned him into an imitator of Hasse. A rapid succession of operas by
      Weisse and Hiller, which were received with unanimous approbation, and
      spread with incredible rapidity, soon established a definite type of
      German operetta, and raised up a host of imitators. The interest of the
      public, especially in North Germany, was almost exclusively confined to
      operetta,<a href="#linknote-250014" name="linknoteref-250014"
      id="linknoteref-250014"> 14 </a> so that in Berlin, for instance, during
      the years 1781-83, 117, 141, and 151 operettas were performed.<a
      href="#linknote-250015" name="linknoteref-250015" id="linknoteref-250015">
      15 </a> This implies an extraordinary production. Besides translations
      from French operettas by Duni, Philidor, Monsigny, GrÃ©try, and Italian
      intermezzi, there were innumerable German vaudevilles, for the most part
      also founded on foreign originals.<a href="#linknote-250016"
      name="linknoteref-250016" id="linknoteref-250016"> 16 </a> Some idea may
      be formed of the fertility of these composers, by the fact that between
      1765 and 1785, Hiller composed 13 operas, Wolf 18, Neefe 10, Holly 13,
      AndrÃ© 22, Schweitzer 16, Stegmann 10, G. Benda 8; to whom may be added a
      host of other less productive and less celebrated composers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This activity had indeed drawbacks, for it was practised with great ease,
      and many amateurs of very inferior musical education intruded themselves
      among the operatic musicians.<a href="#linknote-250017"
      name="linknoteref-250017" id="linknoteref-250017"> 17 </a> The careless
      dilettantism of the poet went hand in hand <span class="side">GERMAN
      OPERETTA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p219.png">[219]</a></span>
      with that of the composer. A host of unskilful verse-makers allied
      themselves with Weisse, Michaelis, and Gotter, and threatened to degrade
      the operetta to the lower level of the opera buffa. A further drawback
      consisted in the very defective performances, which in most instances
      resulted from the insufficient powers of the operetta companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must remember," says Reichardt, in his "History of the Comic Opera,"
      "how much Hiller was hampered by the miserable state of our operatic
      companies. He was fully aware of this, and what I admire in him is that he
      never lost sight of the fact that he was writing, not for singers, but for
      actors, who had scarcely music enough in them to sing over their wine."
      The state of things had not altered much since Hiller began to write. The
      Italian operas alone were supported by the courts; the German operettas
      remained in the hands of private speculators; who did not possess the
      means of attracting vocalists of artistic cultivation. No singer of any
      reputation would have thought it consistent with his dignity to appear in
      German vaudeville. The vaudeville, therefore, remained in the hands of
      actors, who had seldom any vocal powers and still seldomer any but a
      superficial cultivation, but who willingly appeared in operettas on
      account of the high fees<a href="#linknote-250018"
      name="linknoteref-250018" id="linknoteref-250018"> 18 </a> and great
      applause they might reckon upon. Reichardt gives an appalling description
      of the German opera in Berlin in 1774; he heard one of Hiller's operas
      "sung by a wide-mouthed, screeching woman, and a lover with a voice like a
      night-watchman," and that before an audience which had "the reputation of
      very refined taste";<a href="#linknote-250019" name="linknoteref-250019"
      id="linknoteref-250019"> 19 </a> he was no better pleased at Leipzig.<a
      href="#linknote-250020" name="linknoteref-250020" id="linknoteref-250020">
      20 </a> MÃ¼ller says of a performance of Wolf's "Treuen Kohler" at Dresden
      in 1776: "As only two of all the performers were at all musical, you may
      imagine how the opera was <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM
      SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p220.png">[220]</a></span>
      rendered." It is conceivable, therefore, that the growing partiality for
      German opera was regarded with disfavour by earnest men, as prejudicial
      alike to the dramatic interests which were still struggling to assert
      themselves in Germany,<a href="#linknote-250021" name="linknoteref-250021"
      id="linknoteref-250021"> 21 </a> and to the artistic development of
      operatic music proper.<a href="#linknote-250022" name="linknoteref-250022"
      id="linknoteref-250022"> 22 </a> The actor MÃ¼ller, during his professional
      tour in 1776, made himself acquainted with the views of competent judges
      as to the admissibility of German operettas; the different opinions which
      he collected are characteristic enough. Lessing&mdash;who held the union
      of poetry and music as the most perfect in existence, "so that nature
      herself appears to have destined them not so much for union as to be
      considered as one and the same art"<a href="#linknote-250023"
      name="linknoteref-250023" id="linknoteref-250023"> 23 </a>&mdash;was
      against vaudevilles. "They are the ruin of our stage. Such works are
      easily written; every comedy affords material to the author; he scatters a
      few songs about, and the thing is done. Our new dramatic poets find this a
      far easier task than writing a good character piece." Gleim was even more
      violently opposed to vaudeville than Lessing, and gave MÃ¼ller an epigram
      upon the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Witch":&mdash;

     Die, schlau wie

    <p>
      Weisse smiled when MÃ¼ller repeated the lines to him, and declared himself,
      as became the founder of German opera, in its favour. He was too modest,
      however, to maintain that operettas were dramatic works of art, or to hope
      thereby to raise the taste of his countrymen; he could only disclaim all
      intention of degrading it or of doing more than encouraging <span

      the subject, since he had had a direct interest in more than one operatic
      libretto; he would not declare for either side, and was of opinion that
      variety was the root of all pleasure. Wieland was more explicit, and
      declared that the national stage could only be rendered of importance by
      German music; comic and serious German vaudevilles were wanted, but good
      poets would soon come forward to supply the need. He was not only able to
      point to his own "Alceste," and the success it had obtained; he had
      developed his views on the cultivation of German vaudeville with a lively
      acknowledgment of the achievements of Schweitzer, and he possessed genuine
      feeling and interest for music. Even a musician like Reichardt declared
      himself against the operetta, but thought as it was there it ought at
      least to be improved, and made as useful as possible.<a

      The interest which was taken by great poets in the elevation of the
      vaudeville is exemplified by Goethe; after "Erwin und Elmire" and
      "Claudina von Villabella" were written, his intercourse with his early
      friend Christoph Kayser<a href="#linknote-250026" name="linknoteref-250026"
      id="linknoteref-250026"> 26 </a> (b. 1736) caused him to attempt the
      construction of vaudeville after the received type of the Italian
      operetta. His first experiment was "Scherz, List und Rache," which he
      began in 1784, and sent at once to Kayser for composition;<a
      href="#linknote-250027" name="linknoteref-250027" id="linknoteref-250027">
      27 </a> the two first acts were ready the following year, and were well

      29 </a> But Goethe thought that the operetta <span class="side">DIE

      30 </a> and complains himself that a defective conception of the
      intermezzo had led him to spin out the trivial subject into innumerable
      musical pieces, which had been treated by Kayser quite after the
      old-fashioned models. "Unhappily," says Goethe, "adherence to the old
      principles caused it to suffer from poverty of parts; it never went beyond
      a terzet, and one felt inclined to wish that the doctor's medical books
      might be endowed with life to form a chorus. All the pains we took,
      therefore, to confine ourselves within narrow and simple limits went for
      nothing when Mozart appeared. The 'EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail' threw all
      else into the shade, and our carefully worked-out piece was never heard of
      again at any theatre."<a href="#linknote-250031" name="linknoteref-250031"

      A closer examination of Mozart's opera will make it clear to us why it
      threw all others into the shade. The plot of Bretzner's<a

      32 </a> "EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail," written for AndrÃ© in 1781, is simple
      and in no way original:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Constanze, the beloved of Belmont, is in the power of the Pasha Selim, who
      has confined her in his seraglio, and sues in vain for her love. Belmont
      has been made aware of her place of confinement by Pedrillo, his former
      servant, who has also fallen into the hands of the Pasha, and become the
      overseer of his gardens; Belmont hastens to liberate his beloved. In
      seeking Pedrillo he stumbles upon Osmin, overseer of the country-house in
      which the action takes place; and both he and Pedrillo (who is even more
      obnoxious to Osmin from his known love to Blondchen, Constanze's
      waiting-maid, whom Osmin seeks to win) are rudely repulsed by Osmin. In
      the meantime Pedrillo succeeds in recommending Belmont to his master as an
      accomplished architect; Selim takes him into his service, and Osmin is
      reluctantly obliged to admit him to the country-house. In the second act
      Blondchen makes short work of Osmin's arrogant jealousy in respect of her,
      and Constanze remains constant against the renewed attempts of the Pasha.
      Hereupon Pedrillo inveigles Osmin into drinking with him, and renders him
      harmless by means of a sleeping potion; the freedom thus obtained is
      employed by the lovers in an interview at which their flight the following
      night is determined on. In the third act this is put into effect. Pedrillo
      <span class="side">ALTERATIONS IN THE LIBRETTO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p223.png">[223]</a></span> gives the
      sign, Belmont escapes with Constanze; as Pedrillois carrying off
      Blondchen, Osmin enters still half asleep; they contrive to escape but he
      causes them to be pursued, and both couples are brought before the Pasha.
      They are condemned to death, but the Pasha, moved at last by their
      self-sacrificing love and fidelity, pardons and unites them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original libretto is arranged for a genuine vaudeville. All the
      dramatic interest lies in the spoken dialogue; the songs are, with a few
      exceptions, superfluous additions, and imply a very moderate amount of
      execution. Mozart undertook to indicate to Stephanie where and how, in the
      interests of the composer, alterations should be made, and only left to
      him the framing of the text, with which it was not necessary to be so
      particular, if only the situations were well arranged in their main
      features. The principal point, next to giving to the musical element of
      the piece its due prominence as the most fitting expression of lyric
      sentiment, was the proper consideration of the individualities of the
      performers themselves. Fortunately this task was not complicated in the
      way which had so often been the case. Madame Cavalieri was certainly more
      of a bravura singer than anything else, and neither her appearance nor her
      acting was effective; but Adamberger and Fischer were just as Mozart would
      have had them, both as singers and actors, and Fischer especially was an
      extraordinarily gifted artist. The part of Osmin, which was created for
      him, shows the influence of a congenial spirit on the conceptions of the
      creating artist. When Mozart was fairly embarked in the work, he wrote to
      his father about the libretto and the alterations already made in it
      (September 26, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera began with a soliloquy which I have begged Herr Stephanie to
      turn into a little ariette, and also, instead of the two chattering
      together after Osmin's song, to make a duet out of the dialogue. As we
      have given the part to Fischer, who has an excellent bass voice (although
      the Archbishop once told me he sang too low for a bass, and I assured his
      grace that he would sing higher next time), we must give him something to
      do, especially as he is such a favourite with the public. In the original
      book Osmin has only one little song, and nothing else but the terzet and
      finale. I have given him an aria in the first act, and he is to have
      another in the second. I have trusted the aria altogether to Stephanie,
      the music was ready before he knew a word about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p224.png">[224]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      These alterations were of specially good dramatic effect in the first
      scene, and Osmin's song called to life the first German comic aria which
      deserves to be called great. In the second act the dialogue between
      Blondchen and Osmin becomes a duet; on the other hand, a superfluous duet
      between Constanze and Blondchen is very rightly omitted. Instead of it
      Constanze has the great bravura song "Mar-tem aller Arten," chiefly as a
      concession to the singer; for the repetition of the scene in which she
      scornfully rejects the Sultan's proposals is in every way superfluous.
      Blondchen's second song&mdash;newly inserted&mdash;is, however, quite
      appropriate; in it she expresses her joy at her approaching deliverance;
      so that the original duet is really embodied to a certain extent in these
      two songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chief alteration which Mozart contemplated was in the conclusion
      of the second act. In Bretzner's text the abduction scene is treated as a
      grand ensemble movement, with which the third act commences. A long and
      elaborate duet between Belmont and Pedrillo, who are lying in ambush,
      makes the beginning, and then Constanze appears and is carried off by
      Belmont. After Pedrillo has climbed up to Blondchen in the window, Osmin
      comes out of the house still heavy with sleep; but he sees the fugitives
      and has them pursued and brought back by his guard; they beg for mercy,
      seek to regain their liberty by bribery&mdash;in vain; Osmin rages, and
      all the characters are in a state of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's quick eye saw that this scene, bringing together all the
      characters in a succession of rapidly varying and contrasting situations,
      forms the culminating point of the opera; he wished, therefore, that this
      "charming quintet, or rather finale, should be placed at the close of the
      second act." He also saw that this transposition would necessitate other
      important alterations. The second act could be kept together very well by
      the mutual understanding of the two lovers; but the third act, for which
      nothing was reserved but the unravelling of the knot by the clemency of
      the Sultan, if it was to have any substance or interest, "must be provided
      with an entirely new intrigue." The difficulty <span class="side">ALTERATIONS
      IN THE LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p225.png">[225]</a></span>
      of finding this seems to have put a stop to the alteration, and the
      original arrangement remained. But for Bretzner's insignificant finale to
      the second act there was substituted an elaborate quartet, which expresses
      in music the reunion of the lovers in its various aspects of joy and
      jealousy, of disputes and reconciliation. An air for Belmont precedes
      this; it is well-fitted for the situation, and is intended also as a
      concession to the singer, for in this act, where all the other characters
      come to the front, Belmont had originally nothing to sing but the ensemble
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart began the composition of the ensemble movement at the commencement
      of the third act. The greater part of the duet between Belmont and
      Pedrillo before the romanze was sketched out by him in his usual way, the
      voices and bass written in full, the accompaniment indicated here and
      there. It breaks off, however, in the middle; and Mozart appears to have
      purposely laid it aside, convinced that the scene must be differently
      treated.<a href="#linknote-250033" name="linknoteref-250033"
      id="linknoteref-250033"> 33 </a> The ensemble was given up; Mozart saw
      that it would throw the whole opera out of gear, and would concentrate the
      interest and the action at the wrong place. The abduction scene was
      confined to dialogue, only Pedrillo's romanze being left; in addition,
      songs for Belmont and Osmin were inserted, both highly characteristic. The
      duet for Belmont and Constanze, which follows, is altered only in the
      words, not in the situation; the closing catastrophe it was thought well
      to modify. In Bretzner's version the Pasha Selim, who is a renegade,
      recognises in Belmont his son, which leads to the <i>dÃ©nouement</i>;
    </p>
    <p>
      but Stephanie makes him pardon the lovers from generosity and magnanimity,
      which, as a critic remarked, were the fashion of the day in Vienna.<a
      href="#linknote-250034" name="linknoteref-250034" id="linknoteref-250034">
      34 </a> Constanze's song of gratitude at the close is very rightly
      omitted, and replaced by the then customary vaudeville, in which all the
      characters declare in turn: "Wer solche Huld vergessen kann, den seh man
      mit Verachtung an!

    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's father had raised objections to the libretto, and the alterations
      in it; he was particularly concerned that the verses were not in regular
      rhyme throughout. Thereupon his son made him the following remarkable
      answer (October):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now about the text of the opera. As far as Stephanie's work is concerned,
      you are quite right, but the poetry is very well suited to the character
      of the stupid, boorish, and malicious Osmin. I am quite aware that the
      versification is not of the best; but it goes so well with my musical
      thoughts (which were running in my head long before) that I cannot but be
      pleased; and I would wager that no fault will be found in performance.
      Belmont's aria, "O wie Ã¤ngtslich," could scarcely be written better for
      the music. Constanze's aria too is not bad, with the exception of the
      "Hui,"<a href="#linknote-250035" name="linknoteref-250035"
      id="linknoteref-250035"> 35 </a> and the line "Sorrow reposes in my
      bosom," for sorrow cannot repose. After all, in an opera, the poetry must
      be the handmaid of the music. Why do Italian comic operas always please,
      in spite of their wretched librettos&mdash;even in Paris, as I was witness
      myself? Because the music is supreme, and everything else is forgotten.
      All the more then will an opera be likely to please in which the plan of
      the piece is well carried out, and the words are written simply to suit
      the music; not turned and twisted so as to ruin the composition for the
      sake of a miserable rhyme, which God knows does far more harm than good in
      a dramatic representation.<a href="#linknote-250036"
      name="linknoteref-250036" id="linknoteref-250036"> 36 </a> Verse, indeed,
      is indispensable for music, but rhyme is bad in its very nature: and poets
      who go to work so pedantically will certainly come to grief, together with
      the music. It would be by far the best if a good composer who understands
      the theatre, and know-how to produce a piece, and a clever poet, could be
      (like a veritable phoenix), united in one; there would be no reason to be
      afraid as to the applause of the ignorant then. The poets seem to me
      something like trumpeters, with their <span class="side">MUTUAL RELATIONS
      OF MUSIC AND VERSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p227.png">[227]</a></span> mechanical tricks&mdash;if we
      composers were to adhere so closely to our rules (which were well enough
      as long as we knew no better) we should soon produce music just as
      worthless as their worthless books."<a href="#linknote-250037"

    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I think I have talked nonsense enough for this time"&mdash;so Mozart
      concludes this interesting letter, as he was fond of doing when his desire
      to justify himself had led him into general aesthetic questions, on which
      he was averse to expatiating at any length. His opinion as to the relative
      positions of music and poetry in operatic works is unusually interesting.
      In complete opposition to Gluck, who considered music as subordinate to
      poetry, Mozart requires that poetry shall be the handmaid of music. In the
      sense in which the context shows him to have meant it, he is undoubtedly
      right. He exacts that the plan of the piece shall be well laid out; that
      is, that the plot shall be interesting, and shall as it proceeds afford
      dramatic situations fitted for musical expression. He requires further
      that the words shall be written merely for the music, that is, that the
      poetical conceptions shall be of a kind to stimulate the composer, to
      elevate and support him, while allowing him perfect freedom of thought and
      action. He had mentioned Osmin's song to Stephanie, and the music was
      ready before the latter had written a word of the poetry; the words he
      then prepared accorded so admirably with the musical ideas which had been
      running in Mozart's head, that faults here and there in the versification
      did not seem to him of much consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impulse he required for his musical conceptions was the representation
      of the dramatis persona in certain definite situations, not the verbal
      framing of the poet's ideas.<a href="#linknote-250038"
      name="linknoteref-250038" id="linknoteref-250038"> 38 </a> The <span
      class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p228.png">[228]</a></span> points which were contained in
      the verse, and influenced the construction of the musical idea, were to
      him co-operating but not dominating elements. The words of an opera have a
      definite object; they provide foundation and support for the musical
      expression, and are not therefore absolutely independent, as in the drama,<a
      href="#linknote-250039" name="linknoteref-250039" id="linknoteref-250039">
      39 </a> but are obliged to recognise and respect the laws of music, as
      well as those of poetry. To attain this end a compromise is as
      indispensable as in every other union of the sister arts. Architecture, in
      her highest achievements, turns for embellishment to sculpture and
      painting; and no one has ever doubted that in such co-operation each art
      must make some concession to the other. The architectural plan must be so
      conceived as to afford fitting space and position for the sculpture and
      painting; these, on the other hand, must be introduced with a view to the
      essential conditions of the building; the pediment, the arch, the metope
      are not freely selected forms, but constitute the limitations which arise
      from the necessities of the building. The sculptor modifies his style to
      suit the character of the building, the painter knows how to give
      significance to the whole design by skilful composition and combinations
      of colour on the flat surface of the walls. Doubtless architecture, with
      her severe laws and inflexible forms, imposes restrictions on the fancies
      of the artist; but who can imagine that Phidias in the sculptures of the
      Parthenon, Raphael in the Loggia of the Vatican, renounced their freedom
      of design or their independence of execution in obedience to the will of
      the architect? The relation between poetry and music is of the same kind.
      Mozart saw the necessity for co-operation between the musician and the
      poet, if the right effect was to be given in its just proportions. The
      musician must be ready to "give some hints" which shall put the poet in
      possession of his intentions and of the conditions necessitated by the
      rules of his art; the poet must be "intelligent," clever, and cultivated
      enough to fall in with the intentions of the musician, and poet enough to
      retain his poetical powers in spite of these limitations.

      Mozart is quite right in asserting that co-operation of this kind is the
      surest pledge for an altogether satisfactory opera; unhappily he is quite
      right also in declaring such a co-opera-tion to be attainable only by "a
      veritable phoenix."
    </p>
    <p>
      To a certain degree a mutual understanding is of course indispensable, but
      it confines itself, as a rule, to an unwilling concession on this or the
      other side.<a href="#linknote-250040" name="linknoteref-250040"
      id="linknoteref-250040"> 40 </a> Music finally assumes the mastery in
      opera, where it is the actual medium of expression; no one could deny that
      good music would make the poorest verse pass muster, whereas bad music
      could not be made acceptable even when "wedded to immortal verse." But the
      very fact that music appeals direct to the senses gives it an advantage
      when opposed to poetry, which reaches the imagination through the
      intellect; just as a poetical description of a work of art falls far short
      of the effect produced directly on the mind by contemplation of the work
      itself. Music works on the sense of hearing in an as yet inexplicable
      manner, rousing emotions and fancies with an instantaneous power
      surpassing that of poetry. Even if this be disputed, it must be allowed
      that music does not appeal immediately to the intellect as language does.
      Even the species of music which is said to occupy the intellect most
      especially, viz., music in strict forms of counterpoint, does not do it in
      such a way as to enable the hearer to discover the meaning of the
      composition by means of its actual utterances; it exercises his intellect
      otherwise by rousing the desire in him to grasp and hold the artistic
      forms as such, and the laws upon which they depend.<a
      href="#linknote-250041" name="linknoteref-250041" id="linknoteref-250041">
      41 </a> Music must borrow from poetry what it does not possess for itself,
      namely, the ability to call forth a well-defined image which shall
      identify itself with the sentiment evoked i by the music and give to this
      its exact significance. This point is, of course, of special importance in
      opera, although the fact must not be lost sight of that the stage
      accessories <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span

      pantomimic representation come greatly to the aid of the music, so that it
      is quite possible for an audience to follow an opera with interest and
      gratification without understanding the language in which it is written.
      This is a further proof that, important as the poetic details doubtless
      are, the plot and situations are the really essential points. For the
      paradox that a libretto if it is to be musical cannot be poetical, but can
      only have certain external forms of poetic delivery, is certainly false.
      The conditions of poetic delivery and musical execution are essentially
      the same, and a distinction between them is impossible. But the means of
      delivery which the poet has at his disposal are manifold and varied, and
      not all applicable in the same place; if the poet is master of his art,
      and has a clear conception of what he is striving after, he will know what
      are the particular means he ought to employ to be in accord with the
      musical part of the work.<a href="#linknote-250042"

      Bretzner was very indignant at the proposed alterations in his libretto,
      and inserted the following notice in the "Berliner Litteratur und
      Theater-Zeitung" (No. 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It has pleased some hitherto unknown person in Vienna to take in hand my
      opera, "Belmont und Constanze," or "Die EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail," and to
      publish the piece in a very altered form. The alterations in the dialogue
      are not considerable, and may be passed over; but the adapter has inserted
      a vast number of songs, the words of which are in many cases edifying and
      touching in the highest possible degree. I would not willingly deprive the
      improver of the glory belonging to his work, and I therefore take this
      opportunity of specifying these inserted songs as belonging to the Vienna
      edition and Mozart's composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, and after giving "a specimen of the improver's work from
      the quartet," Bretzner exclaims: "And this is called improvement!"
      Nevertheless the text was improved, and although far from first-rate, it
      had been rendered a fairly satisfactory and practicable libretto, which
      has not yet been very far surpassed in the literature of German comic
      opera. The plot is certainly not thrilling, but it <span class="side">THE
      "ENTFÃœHRUNG," A GERMAN OPERA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p231.png">[231]</a></span> allows the natural development
      of a succession of musical situations. It was, as we have seen, Mozart's
      merit to recognise these in his musical representation, to make them
      available in such a way as to distinguish the "EntfÃ¼hrung" from all
      earlier vaudevilles and operettas.

      Mozart's performance was not confined to the adoption of certain
      ready-developed forms of Italian opera, pressed into the service of the
      German opera, partly from necessity, partly from the narrow principle that
      the songs were to be sung by personages of supposed high position.<a

      43 </a> This would have been no sufficient reason for substituting the
      aria for the Lied; it was done to give full scope to musical construction,

      the artistic conditions of the dramatic situations, and in the nature of
      the musical expression.<a href="#linknote-250044" name="linknoteref-250044"

      At home as he was in Italian, French and German opera, in sacred and
      instrumental music, he had obtained such a mastery over musical forms as
      gave him a freedom of action which his favourable circumstances in Vienna
      allowed him to make use of, and the fact that he was composing a German
      opera gave him a sense of a still higher freedom. He was German in every
      thought and feeling, and German music was his natural way of expressing
      himself as an artist, requiring no unusual form, no special
      characterisation, nothing but freedom of thought and action. In the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung," German sentiment, emotion, and disposition found expression
      for the first time at the hands of a true artist. It is easy to understand
      how the fulness of life and truth in such a work would throw into the
      shade all who believed solely in those forms which were borrowed from
      foreign <span class="side">DIE EXTFÃœHRUXG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span

      name="linknoteref-250045" id="linknoteref-250045"> 45 </a> This truly
      German and truly Mozart-like style is nowhere more decidedly exemplified
      than in the part of Belmont. It is only necessary to note the contrast
      between the male sopranos of the opera seria, or the comic lovers of the
      opera buffa, and this Belmont, who expresses manly love in all its force
      and intensity. It is plain that his love is not the wild and transitory
      gleam of passion, but an emotion having its roots deep in the heart,
      sanctified by sorrow, and held with the constancy of a true moral nature.
      Manliness is the ground-tone of all his agitated sentiments; the steady
      glow of a well-balanced mind penetrates every" expression of his feelings.
      It is an easier task to portray the wild excitement of passion than to
      depict a mind and character in its totality by means of each separate
      expression;<a href="#linknote-250046" name="linknoteref-250046"
      id="linknoteref-250046"> 46 </a> and the conception of love, the essential
      motive power of musical drama, from this point of view, marks an era in
      musical representation, important alike for its national character and its
      artistic construction. It was not by mere chance that Mozart made the
      tenor voice, which had been virtually deprived of its proper province in
      Italian opera, into the organ of manly love and tenderness. Belmont has
      become a type in German opera. Adamberger, judging from contemporary
      testimony was the most fitting representative of such a character.<a
      href="#linknote-250047" name="linknoteref-250047" id="linknoteref-250047">
      47 </a> Various songs composed for him by Mozart characterise him as a

    <p>
      Belmont's character and tone of mind are drawn in firm lines in his first
      cavatina (1). His state of anxious suspense is implied rather than fully
      indicated by his expression of secret devotion. But this little song,
      which none but a master-hand could have thrown off so lightly and so
      surely, is of most significance, by reason of its connection with the
      overture. Mozart makes no remark to his father on the overture except that
      it was short, and that "it alternates between forte and piano, the Turkish
      music being always forte, modulated by changes of key, and I do not think
      any one can go to sleep over it, even if they have lain awake all the
      night before" (September 26, 1781). As usual, when he speaks of his
      compositions, he only indicates the means employed and the external
      effect, and does not attempt any verbal description of the music itself.
      It is certainly true that a lively and incessant suspense is kept up by
      the constant modulatory changes, especially from major to minor, and by
      sharp contrasts of <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i>. But this is not all; the
      character of the overture is so singularly fanciful that a few bars
      suffice to place the hearer in an imaginative mood. The most varied
      emotions of joy and sorrow are lightly touched, but never held, the tone
      of the whole is so fresh and cheerful that the listener involuntarily
      yields to the spell; and the impressions of the new world in which he
      finds himself are heightened by the highly original tone-colouring. Then
      comes a slower movement, expressing longing desires in the tenderest, most
      appealing tones. It has scarcely died away before we are again whirled
      along our fantastic course, which ends in an appealing cry, followed
      without a pause by Belmont's cavatina, "Hier soli ich dich denn sehen,
      Constanze!" We recognise at <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM
      SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p234.png">[234]</a></span>
      once the middle movement of the overture, but changed from the minor to
      the major key. This change, and the difference of shading between the
      arrangement for the voice and that for the orchestra, give to the charming
      little movement two distinct expressions, just as the same landscape has
      two different aspects seen at noon or in the moonlight. The overture
      renders us free to receive the effect of the work of art as such, prepared
      by what forms the starting-point of the work; and the first song sets the
      crown on the overture, while it transports us at once into the frame of
      mind which predominates throughout the opera. Still more important in its
      climax and composition is Belmont's second song (4). The situation is more
      definitely developed; Belmont knows now that Constanze is there, that he
      will soon see her, and this certainty condenses all the emotions roused by
      the memory of a sorrowful past, and the prospect of a perilous future,
      into the one feeling of their speedy reunion. Mozart was so taken with
      this song that he wrote it down as soon as he received the libretto. "This
      is the favourite song of all who have heard it&mdash;myself included," he
      wrote to his father (September 26, 1781), "and is exactly calculated for
      Adamberger's voice. 'Fo wie Ã¤ngstlich, o wie feurigl' You can imagine how
      it is expressed, with the very beating of the heart&mdash;the violins in
      octaves. One can see the trembling, the hesitation, the very swelling of
      the breast is expressed by a crescendo, one can hear the sighs, the
      whispers, rendered by the violins muted, with one flute in unison."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be doing Mozart an injustice to consider this sound-painting as
      his first object; it is in reality but a subordinate, although a very
      effective and useful element of the whole musical conception. Belmont's
      two other songs&mdash;one in the second act, before the meeting with
      Constanze (15),<a href="#linknote-250049" name="linknoteref-250049"
      id="linknoteref-250049"> 49 </a> and the other at the beginning of the
      third act, before the <span class="side">CONSTANZE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p235.png">[235]</a></span> abduction
      (17)<a href="#linknote-250050" name="linknoteref-250050"
      id="linknoteref-250050"> 50 </a>&mdash;are much quieter in tone, and are
      characterised by manly composure combined with warm sensibility. These
      qualities are visible also in the musical construction of the broad and
      expressive cantilene, which allows free scope for the display of a full
      tenor voice in its best position. The structure of the melodies diverges
      in a remarkable degree from that which predominates in Mozart's Italian
      operas, and approaches nearer to that employed in his instrumental music.
      And yet the national character of the melodies is not so pronounced in the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung" as in the "Zauber-flÃ¶te," nor are the songs in their whole
      design so completely absolved from Italian forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part of Constanze, so far as musical characterisation is concerned, is
      not nearly so well thought out as that of Belmont. "I have been obliged,"
      writes Mozart to his father (September 26, 1781), "to sacrifice
      Constanze's song (6) in some degree to the voluble organ of Mdlle.
      Cavalieri. But I have sought to express 'Trennung war mein banges Loos und
      nun schwimmt mein Aug' in Thranen' as far as is compatible with an Italian
      bravura song."<a href="#linknote-250051" name="linknoteref-250051"
      id="linknoteref-250051"> 51 </a> We shall readily allow that he has been
      so far successful; and that, apart from the inserted bravura passages, the
      song is not only fine from a musical point of view, but appropriate to the
      situation. But in the great bravura song of the second act everything has
      been sacrificed to Mdlle. Cavalieri's voluble organ, and, as Gluck would
      have said, it <i>smells of music</i>,<a href="#linknote-250052"
      name="linknoteref-250052" id="linknoteref-250052"> 52 </a> It is, as we
      have seen, inserted without reference to the plot, and this may have led
      to the further consequence of treating it altogether as an extraneous
      piece. As regards length and difficulty, it is one of the greatest of
      bravura songs, and is accompanied by four obbligato instruments&mdash;flute,
      oboe, violin, and <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p236.png">[236]</a></span>
      violoncello.<a href="#linknote-250053" name="linknoteref-250053"
      id="linknoteref-250053"> 53 </a> Considered as a concert piece it is of
      importance by reason of the plan, artistic in design and execution, which
      permits the treatment of the five obbligato parts as integral divisions of
      the whole, while making due provision for sound effects and musical
      interest. The song is still often sung, although the glitter surrounding
      mere execution has passed away. But it does not belong to the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung." Together with the brilliant execution there is a certain
      heroic tone in the song which is quite out of keeping with the opera and
      with the character of Constanze in it. The true Con-stanze, as Mozart
      imagined her, is found in the second air (10), which expresses with much
      truth and intensity the ardent longing of the maiden sorrowing for her
      lover. Firmness and assurance are manly attributes, but a dreamy resigned
      absorption in the contemplation of vanished happiness is proper to a
      woman, and to this maidenly sentiment Mozart has given beautiful
      expression. This feminine tone gives the song a certain resemblance to
      that of Ilia in "Idomeneo" (Vol. II., p. 151); but the latter is, as the
      situation requires, drawn in darker lines, and takes more hold on the
      mind. Here as elsewhere the same point is noticeable, viz., that when
      Mozart works outward from the heart of an individual situation, the
      separate elements of the musical construction are more striking, and the
      form is freer and more lifelike than it would otherwise be.<a
      href="#linknote-250054" name="linknoteref-250054" id="linknoteref-250054">
      54 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The instrumentation also is peculiarly effective, especially by the
      employment of the wind instruments, which shed a gentle glow over the
      whole. Mozart, against his custom, <span class="side">OSMIN.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p237.png">[237]</a></span> makes use of
      the basset-horn instead of the clarinet in this song. In the part of
      Belmont, too, the instrumentation is modified to some extent. The second
      song (4) is very delicate and tender in its instrumentation, the wind
      instruments being treated as solos, although not concertante; in the
      others there is a very pithy forcible tone, which in the last (16) becomes
      almost brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duet (20), owing to the singularity of the situation, differs
      materially in character from an ordinary love duet. Within sight of death
      each of the lovers has the painful consciousness of having led the other
      to destruction; and their mutual endeavour to console one another with the
      certainty of their love, which death may consummate but cannot destroy,
      raises them to the height of enthusiastic inspiration. This sentiment is
      excellently well expressed in the first calm movement with fervour and
      clearness, and a perceptible blending of painful emotion and loving
      consolation; the second movement does not quite reach the same high level.
      Not only do some of the passages, and the very tedious conclusion, make
      concessions to passing effect, but the expression does not rise to the
      ecstatic strain which is implied in the situation.<a
      href="#linknote-250055" name="linknoteref-250055" id="linknoteref-250055">
      55 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble forms of the two lovers stand in the sharpest contrast to that
      of Osmin, which is altogether Mozart's creation, and certainly one of the
      most original characters of dramatic music. The very way in which he is
      introduced is masterly. After Belmont has sung his cavatina, which
      breathes the noblest love and constancy, Osmin comes out of the house to
      gather figs; he sings a song for his pastime; it is a love song, but one
      suggested by painful jealousy. The minor key of Osmin's song gives it a
      wild, desolate expression, in strong contrast to the cheerful candour of
      the cavatina; many popular songs have this expression, and Osmin's song is
      successfully imitated from the popular style. The phrasing is clumsy in
      spite of the marked rhythm, but the effect is quite startling when Osmin
      in a complacent hum <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p238.png">[238]</a></span> repeats
      the last words an octave lower, and then at once breaks out into a wild
      "Trallalera!" The uncouth fellow lolls and stretches so completely at his
      ease that there cannot be a moment's doubt of how unamiable he will prove
      to be if any one should venture to cross his path.<a
      href="#linknote-250056" name="linknoteref-250056" id="linknoteref-250056">
      56 </a> This is soon put to the proof. He refuses with assumed
      indifference to answer Belmont's repeated inquiries, and on the latter
      interrupting him (involuntarily, as it were, with the melody of his own
      song, which has so irritated Belmont), the unabashed rudeness of Osmin
      breaks out in speech. It is as interesting as instructive to note how in
      this duet the simplest and easiest means of musical representation are
      used to produce a continuous climax and the most lively characterisation.
      While it is still in full train Pedrillo enters, and Osmin turns upon him
      with a fresh outbreak of rage in the song which Mozart had spoken of to
      his father (3). Again changing his tactics, he endeavours to repress his
      opponent with all the weight of his dignity and cleverness. Gravity and
      importance, expressed by the rhythm, the pompous intervals, the syncopated
      accompaniment, alternate with impatience and haste, when the singer
      becomes irritated. Very characteristic is the demeanour of Osmin as he
      complacently nurses the thought: "I have my wits about me!" ("Ich hab'
      auch Ver-stand!"). He works himself gradually up into a rage, and the
      threats which he pours forth in a breath fall like blows on the head of
      the hapless Pedrillo. The effect is produced by the accentuation given to
      the rapid flow of words; the first fourth of every bar is forcibly given
      by the orchestra, and the second is taken up by the voice in fifths, and
      then in octaves. At last he comes to a triumphant close, and one thinks it
      is all over. But he has only stopped to take breath, and at once resuming
      his furious course, he ends by completely overpowering his opponent.
      Mozart writes to his father on the conclusion of this song (September 26,
      1781): "The 'Drum beim Barte des Propheten' is in the same time, but the
      notes are more rapid, and as his anger grows one imagines the climax must
      be close at hand; the allegro assai <span class="side">OSMIN&mdash;TURKISH
      MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p239.png">[239]</a></span>
      follows in quite a different time and key, and has an excellent effect. A
      man in such violent rage oversteps all bounds of moderation, and loses all
      command over himself, and so must the music. But since," he continues,
      expressing in simple words that wherein lies the charm of all true art,
      "since the passions, violent or not, must never be carried to the point of
      producing disgust, and the music, however thrilling, must never fail to
      satisfy the ear, consequently must always remain music, I have not chosen
      a distant key to follow the F (the key of the song) but an allied one; not
      the nearest key of all, D minor, but the farther one of A minor." In point
      of fact, the effect of the minor key is extraordinary, both here and in
      other places where it is only cursorily touched. It adds to the frenzied
      wildness of the character in which lust and cruelty are blended, and it is
      emphasised by the strongly marked though monotonous rhythm. And how
      wonderfully all these characteristics are enhanced by the instrumentation!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Osmin's rage," writes Mozart, "acquires a comic element by the
      introduction of the Turkish music." The effect is enhanced by the
      simplicity which has hitherto characterised the instrumentation. The oboes
      (with bassoons and horns) predominate until, in the last verse:
      "Sonderlich beim Monden-scheine," a flute insinuates itself with very good
      effect. There are many characteristic touches in spite of the scanty means
      at disposal, as for instance, the mocking entry of the oboe at the words,
      "Ich hab' auch Verstand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turkish music serves for far more than local colour and
      characterisation. The expression of fanaticism is coloured as well as
      heightened by the shrill sound of the piccolo flute, the blows of the drum
      and cymbals, and the tingle of the triangles.<a href="#linknote-250057"
      name="linknoteref-250057" id="linknoteref-250057"> 57 </a> The
      bewilderment produced by these <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM
      SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p240.png">[240]</a></span>
      instruments, the breathless rapidity of the movement, and the monotony of
      the rhythm make one feel that giddiness must ensue if it goes on much
      longer. But Mozart never makes us giddy, he makes use of the most forcible
      means for characterisation, but never to the point of becoming painful,
      and all with so much cheerfulness and humour that the total effect is
      decidedly pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make acquaintance with Osmin's boorish character in many different
      situations; he is true to himself in them all. The second great song (19)
      contrasts in some measure with the first. He is triumphant, he has his
      enemies in his power, and he is beside himself with joy; but he retains
      the same savage nature, and in the midst of all his rejoicing the main
      point for him is that he can now loll and stretch himself comfortably,
      which he proceeds to do to his heart's content on the long-sustained A and
      D, to which he easily carries his scale. Especially characteristic is the
      middle movement of this song. One seems to see a wild beast, now yawning
      and stretching, now crouching for a spring; grim cruelty and lustful
      indolence are wonderfully characterised by the alternation of octaves and
      dissonant suspensions in the accompaniment, as well as by the triplet
      passages which are given by the orchestra in unison, as if there could be
      no harmony here; the expression of joy is mingled with unspeakable
      brutality, and comes to a climax in the shrill note of exultation at the
      close.<a href="#linknote-250058" name="linknoteref-250058"
      id="linknoteref-250058"> 58 </a> But Osmin shows himself a true poltroon
      in the duet with Blondchen (9)&mdash;her snappish impudence completely
      gets the better of him, and although he endeavours to overawe her with the
      deepest notes of his deep bass voice, her persiflage drives her unwieldy
      antagonist quite out of the field. The lament which he thereupon sings:
      "Ihr Englander, seid ihrnicht Thoren, ihr lasst euren Weibem den Willen!"
      ("You Englishmen, what fools you are, to leave your wives their freedom!")
      is in contrast to his love song, and completes the conception of it. Here
      there is nothing of <span class="side">OSMIN.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p241.png">[241]</a></span> the barbarous nature which
      showed itself in lust and jealousy, but only the pitiful whining of a
      slavish soul which trembles before a resolute woman's will. The
      characterisation of the last movement&mdash;when Osmin gives up all
      appearance of superiority and yields upon every point&mdash;is charming,
      and produced by the simplest musical means. He displays another side of
      his character in the duet (14) in which Pedrillo induces him to drink.<a
      href="#linknote-250059" name="linknoteref-250059" id="linknoteref-250059">
      59 </a> His senses are soon overcome, and he endeavours to outvie
      Pedrillo. It is of advantage to the situation that the personality of the
      singers required that even here Osmin must be considered the chief person;
      one only needs to hear the arrogance with which he delivers the principal
      subject in order to feel sure on whom the wine will take strongest effect,<a
      href="#linknote-250060" name="linknoteref-250060" id="linknoteref-250060">
      60 </a> and even when the rapidly concluded entente cordiale is expressed
      in unison, Osmin's low-pitched octaves keep the upper hand. But here, too,
      Mozart keeps within bounds, and never goes beyond a joke; Osmin's drunken
      sleep is excluded from his representation. Osmin's character is least
      strongly characterised in the terzet (7), of which Mozart writes to his
      father as follows (September 26, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the terzet which concludes the first act. Pedrillo has represented
      his master as an architect, which affords him an opportunity of meeting
      his Constanze in the garden. The Pasha has taken him into his service; and
      Osmin, as overseer, and knowing nothing of this, is insolent to him as a
      stranger, being himself an unmannerly churl and the arch-enemy of all
      strangers, and refuses to allow him to enter the garden. The first
      movement is short, and as the words allowed of it I <span class="side">DIE
      ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p242.png">[242]</a></span> have kept the three voices
      fairly well together; but then begins the major <i>pianissimo</i>, which
      must go very fast, and the conclusion will draw many tears, which is just
      what the conclusion of a first act should do; the more tears the better&mdash;but
      the shorter the better, so that the audience may not forget the applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see from this that Mozart thought more in this instance of a vivid
      expression of the situation than of minute characterisation, and all the
      three characters are alike in their urging and scolding. The advisability,
      therefore, of keeping the three voices "fairly well" together, their
      imitative arrangement keeping up the impression of great excitement, is
      indicated by the situation, although, owing to the necessity for stricter
      attention to form, the individual characterisation is thereby limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Osmin's last appearance in the finale is very amusing. While all the other
      characters are expressing their gratitude, in the favourite form of a
      round, Osmin tries in vain to keep in the same track; but the round sticks
      in his throat, and his angry spite will have vent; the hunting-song of the
      first act with the obbligato janizaries' music rushes once more past our
      ears. Although some elements borrowed from the conventional forms of the
      Italian bass buffo are discernible in the part of Osmin, yet Mozart has
      made use of them in such an entirely original manner that they are closely
      interwoven in his own creation. It is, however, the consistency of the
      individual characterisation which distinguishes the part of Osmin and
      raises it far above the ordinary buffo parts, causing it to afford a
      striking instance of Mozart's eminent talent for dramatic construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part requires a performer such as Fischer, of whom Reichardt writes:
      "He is an excellent bass singer; his voice has the depth of a violoncello,
      and the height of an ordinary tenor; its compass is&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      so that his deep notes are never harsh, nor his high ones shrill; his
      voice flows with ease and certainty, and is full of charm. In praise of
      his style I need only say that he is a <span class="side">FISCHER.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p243.png">[243]</a></span> worthy
      pupil of the great tenor Raaff, who was, and still is considered, the best
      tenor in all Europe. Fischer has a more flexible organ than perhaps any
      other bass singer, and his acting is as good in serious drama as in
      comic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such materials as this are calculated to bring forth good effects. Among
      them may be noted the original sense of climax which Mozart produces by
      repeating a passage an octave lower; this is done in the Lied and in both
      of Osmin's airs at the words "Ich hab' auch Verstand" (3), and "Denn nun
      hab ich vor euch Ruh!" (19). The same effect occurs in the beautiful song
      "Non sÃ¶ d'onde viene," composed also for Fischer; an expressive and
      sustained passage is repeated an octave lower, and the effect is very
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to give an adequate idea of Fischer's powers, the two serious
      songs composed for him by Mozart must be considered along with this
      decidedly comic part. The above-mentioned, "Non sÃ² d'onde viene" (512 K.),
      broad in conception and style, displays the whole compass and wealth of
      Fischer's organ in the most favourable light. The other, "Aspri rimorsi
      atroce" (432 K.), composed in 1783, is remarkable for the expression of a
      gloomy, agitated mood, not illumined by any ray of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expressive recitative is followed by a single movement (allegro, F
      minor) in incessant agitation, the almost uninterrupted triplets of the
      stringed instruments giving it the character of trembling unrest. The
      voice part is very striking by reason of its decided rhythm and frequent
      dissonant intervals; but it is mostly declamatory, and there is no
      appearance of a cantilene proper; the wind instruments give effect to the
      strong accents. The whole song pursues its rapid course like a gloomy
      nocturne, and dies away at last in a dull moan. This song is distinguished
      among all that Mozart has written by its uninterrupted expression of
      gloomy passion, and it would be almost inconceivable that he intended it
      for concert singing, did we not know that Fischer was to sing it: he was
      unsurpassed in every species of delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parts of Blondchen and Pedrillo are not by any <span class="side">DIE
      ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p244.png">[244]</a></span> means so important in their
      characterisation as those of the principal personages, neither have they
      much influence on the development of the plot. Blondchen, besides her
      share in the duet with Osmin, has two songs, of which the first (8) is in
      no way remarkable, written evidently for a seconda donna. The only point
      to be noted is a passage going up to&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which gives proof of Mdlle. Teyber's vocal powers.<a
      href="#linknote-250061" name="linknoteref-250061" id="linknoteref-250061">
      61 </a> The second song (12) is far fresher and more original, and
      expresses heartfelt joy in so lively and charming a manner, without ever
      overstepping the province of a good-humoured soubrette, that the hearer is
      involuntarily beguiled into the same cheerful frame of mind. A German
      element is unmistakably present (we are reminded of the "Zauberflote"),
      and we may note the first appearance of those naÃ¯ve girl-parts common to
      German opera.<a href="#linknote-250062" name="linknoteref-250062"
      id="linknoteref-250062"> 62 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart has given to Pedrillo's song (15) somewhat of a military tone,
      suggested perhaps by the opening words "Frisch zum Kampfe!" and although
      his servile nature is indicated here and there in the accompaniment, the
      effect of the whole is too forcible and brilliant for the character.<a
      href="#linknote-250063" name="linknoteref-250063" id="linknoteref-250063">
      63 </a> On the other hand, the romanze (18) which he sings in the third
      act to the guitar is a jewel of delicate characterisation. Not, however,
      with any reference to Pedrillo himself, for he sings the song, not from
      personal impulse, but as something he has heard and learnt; but the
      strange effects of harmony and rhythm, the mixture of bold <span
      class="side">PEDRILLO&mdash;QUARTET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p245.png">[245]</a></span> knightly impulse with timid
      dismay, is so fantastic, so unreal, that we seem to be ourselves in
      Moorish lands, and are readily persuaded that we are listening to genuine
      Moorish music. But we are listening, in fact, to no music but Mozart's,
      whose own mind evolved the music which the situation demanded, without any
      previous philological study of Moorish national melodies. The two choruses
      of janizaries (so Mozart calls them in the score<a href="#linknote-250064"
      name="linknoteref-250064" id="linknoteref-250064"> 64 </a> ) are not only
      characterised by the Turkish airs they embody, but by original harmonies
      and rhythm which give them a foreign and national character, without any
      special regard as to whether it is actually Turkish or not.<a
      href="#linknote-250065" name="linknoteref-250065" id="linknoteref-250065">
      65 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already had occasion to remark how the ensemble movements proceed
      naturally from the exigencies of the situation, and are therefore
      essential to the musical characterisation of the work. This is especially
      true of the quartet (16), which forms the conclusion of the second act.
      Belmont and Constanze meet for the first time in the Pasha's garden, where
      are also Blondchen and Pedrillo. The meeting of the lovers is the more
      significant, since it is in anticipation of their approaching flight. An
      unusually elevated tone of sentiment is therefore common to them all; but
      the particular circumstances produce many different shades of feeling, and
      each character has its own distinct peculiarities. It is the task of the
      composer to combine this multifariousness into an artistic whole. The
      scenic accessories come very happily to his aid. The two pairs of lovers
      wander about the garden in close converse, so that they are heard
      sometimes apart, sometimes one after the other, sometimes together,
      according to the requirements of the situation and of the musical
      grouping. The beginning is a simple matter. Constanze and Belmont <span
      class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p246.png">[246]</a></span> express their feelings in a
      short duet-like movement, full of heart, such as Mozart has made proper to
      lovers. When they turn aside Pedrillo and Blondchen advance, deep in
      consultation on the flight, so that the music assumes a lighter and more
      cheerful tone. But their thoughts are also occupied with the approaching
      happy turn in their fortunes, and when Belmont and Constance draw near,
      they all spontaneously join in the expression of joyful emotion. Small
      touches betray the master. The consultation between Pedrillo and Blondchen
      is in A major, and closes with an easy phrase on the words: "WÃ¤r der
      Augenblick schon da!" ("O, that the moment had come!"), very expressive of
      the girl's character. The orchestra at once takes up this phrase with
      great emphasis, produced both by the sudden change to the key of D major
      and by the forcible unison of the instruments, as if they were exclaiming,
      "It has come!" and then leads back simply and expressively to the leading
      motif, which now for the first time asserts its full significance:&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the tone grows troubled. Belmont cannot repress a feeling of
      jealousy, and, embarrassed and confused, he seeks to express his doubts to
      Constanze, who does not understand him. Pedrillo follows in the same
      direction to Blondchen, who is far more ready in apprehending his meaning.
      The oboe gives charming expression to the feelings which the jealous
      lovers scarcely dare to clothe in words. Then Belmont and Constanze came
      forward again. The two men speak together, each after his manner&mdash;Belmont
      noble and open, Pedrillo with chattering haste. Constanze bursts into
      tears, Blondchen answers Pedrillo with a box on the ears; the women lament
      together, and the men are aware that they have gone too far. After the
      lively expression of these contrasting emotions in rapid alternation,
      <span class="side">QUARTET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p247.png">[247]</a></span> the lovers emerge from the
      confusion, explain themselves as to their true feelings, and so prepare
      for the reconciliation. The short ensemble movement in which Mozart
      consummates this dÃ©nouement (andante 6-8) is one of those passages of
      which a friend used to say that "der liebe Gott" himself could not have
      done it better; the purest beauty and a truly holy expression of
      satisfaction penetrates the simple and unpretending phrase. The magic of
      such conceptions cannot be rendered in words, nor can it be satisfactorily
      indicated by what actual means the effect is attained, and yet it is
      always of interest to see the master in his workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see in this case that the key selected (A major) combines
      with the rhythm and the harmonic treatment to produce the wished-for
      effect. It gives the voices a pitch allowing of the clearest and most
      melodious tones, heightened in their effect by the deeper pitch of the
      accompanying stringed instruments, and it also, although in fact the
      nearest key to the principal one, produces an impression of surprise as
      great as though it were a more distant one. This is due to what precedes
      the adoption of the A major key. The first movement in D major is followed
      by one in G minor, which leads to E flat major, B minor, F major; D minor
      is just touched, but only to pass again through C minor and B flat major
      into G minor, with a rapid transition into E major. After this restless
      change of key, the passage into A major has a wonderfully tranquillising
      effect, and the adherence to the key throughout the movement gives it a
      peculiar charm. But the reconciliation has not yet taken place; the lovers
      sue for pardon, but the two women allow them first to feel their
      injustice, and here Blondchen assumes the lead by virtue of her fluent
      tongue, while the men supplicate more and more earnestly, until at last
      peace is concluded. This movement is a model of dramatic characterisation.
      An excellent effect is produced by Blondchen's singing throughout in
      triplets (12-8 against 4-4), in contrast to the calm flowing melodies for
      the other voices. The movement only acquires its full significance by
      contrast with what has preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">DIE ENTFÃœHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p248.png">[248]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When pardon has been granted, every trace of past sorrow is obliterated by
      the feeling of complete satisfaction. After so much mental strain a
      complete relaxation is necessary from a musical point of view. The last
      movement is therefore very simple, although appropriately brilliant and
      fiery. It seldom departs from the principal key, and is frequently in
      canon form; very light passages for the voices, rapid instrumentation, and
      an unusually effective <i>crescendo</i> at the close, give it an impulsive
      and quickening effect. This was the first really dramatic ensemble
      movement in a German opera, and in it we find concentrated all Mozart's
      services to the German opera&mdash;a full and free employment of all the
      means afforded by song and orchestra to give musical expression to
      emotion, without subservience to any more binding forms than those laws
      which are founded on the nature of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masterly treatment of the orchestra in the "EntfÃ¼hrung has been
      repeatedly pointed out, and there is no need to repeat that Mozart turned
      to account all the advantages offered to him by the Vienna orchestra. In
      comparison with "Idomeneo" the instrumentation is not exactly scantier,
      but it is clearer and simpler; the tendency to employ the different
      instruments independently, to bring forward subordinate subjects, &amp;c.,
      is held in check, and the details are more lightly treated on account of
      stage effects. "I think I may venture to lay down," says Weber, "that in
      the 'EntfÃ¼hrung' Mozart's <i>artist experience</i> came to maturity, and
      that his <i>experience of the world</i> alone was to lead him to further
      efforts. The world might look for several operas from him like 'Figaro'
      and 'Don Juan,' but with the best will possible he could only write one
      'EntfÃ¼hrung.' I seem to perceive in it what the happy years of youth are
      to every man; their bloom never returns, and the extirpation of their
      defects carries with it some charms which can never be recovered."<a

      CHAPTER XXVI. COURTSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT has often been pointed out that Mozart wrote the "EntfÃ¼hrung" as an
      accepted lover; and many analogies have been drawn <span class="side">THE
      WEBERS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p249.png">[249]</a></span>
      between his own love affairs and those represented in the opera, with the
      view of accounting for the depth and truth of his expression of the
      tenderest of passions. It is true that Mozart could not have rendered love
      so truly without having felt it in its full intensity. But if we stop to
      realise the difficulties and vexations with which Mozart had to struggle
      as a lover, we shall rather wonder that he could compose at all under such
      circumstances, and the EntfÃ¼hrung" becomes a striking proof that creative
      genius sets the artist free from the pressure of life, and raises him into
      the region of beauty in which true art is begotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen the relief it was to Mozart, when obliged to quit the
      house of the Archbishop, to find a lodging with Madame Weber, his old
      Mannheim friend. After Aloysia's marriage to the actor Lange, the mother
      lived in somewhat reduced circumstances with her other three daughters,
      and was glad to let her spare rooms; it was a comfort to Mozart to be
      relieved by friendly hands of the little housekeeping cares which he was
      ill-fitted to attend to himself. But his father was averse to the
      arrangement; he feared that the Webers would make a tool of him, as they
      had, in his opinion, in Mannheim. He was not at all satisfied with
      Wolfgang's reassurances on the subject, and pressed him to take another
      lodging; Wolfgang declared himself quite willing if he could find one
      equally comfortable. As this did not seem likely, and a report reached
      Salzburg that Mozart was engaged to be married to one of Madame Weber's
      daughters, his father insisted on compliance with his desire. Wolfgang
      answered (July 25, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat that I have long wished to take another lodging, if only to stop
      people's chatter; and it annoys me to have to do it for the sake of <span
      class="side">COURTSHIP.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p250.png">[250]</a></span> absurd gossip, in which there is
      not a word of truth. I should like to know what pleasure it can be to
      certain people to spread such baseless reports. Because I am living with
      the family I must, forsooth, marry the daughter! There is no talk of
      affection&mdash;they jump over all that; I simply go to the house, and
      then get married. If ever in my life I was far from thinking of marriage,
      it is at this moment. I wish for nothing less than a rich wife; and even
      if I could make a good marriage now I must perforce wait, for I have other
      things in my head. God has not given me my talent that I might cripple it
      with a wife, and waste my prime in inactivity. Shall I embitter my life at
      its very opening? I have nothing to say against matrimony, but for me at
      present it would be an unmitigated evil. Well, if there is no other way,
      false as it all is, I must avoid even the appearance of it, although the
      appearance has no foundation except my lodging in the house. No one who
      does not live in the house can imagine how very little intercourse I have
      with them; for the children seldom go out&mdash;never except to the play&mdash;and
      I cannot accompany them because I am seldom at home at that hour. We have
      been on the Prater once or twice, but the mother was with us; being in the
      house I could not avoid going, and I heard no such foolish gossip then. I
      must tell you, too, that I paid only <i>my own</i> share;<a
      href="#linknote-26001" name="linknoteref-26001" id="linknoteref-26001"> 1
      </a> and the mother, having become aware of the gossip from others as well
      as from myself, objects to our going anywhere together again, and has
      herself advised me to move my quarters to avoid further annoyance, for she
      says she would not willingly injure me, however innocently. This is my
      only reason for leaving, and this is no valid reason; but people's mouths
      must be stopped. It would not be difficult to find a better room, but very
      difficult to meet with such kind and obliging people. I will not say that
      I am uncivil and never speak to the young lady to whom report has wedded
      me, but I am not in love with her; I chat and joke with her when I have
      time&mdash;that is in the evenings, when I sup at home; in the morning I
      write in my own room, and in the afternoon I am nearly always out&mdash;and
      so that is really all about it. If I am to marry all the girls I have made
      fun with, I shall have at least a hundred wives. Now farewell, my dear
      father, and trust your son, who has really the best intentions towards all
      honest people! Trust him, and believe him sooner than certain people who
      have nothing better to do than to calumniate honest folk.

      An unfinished allegro to a clavier sonata (400 K.) remains as a curious
      and amusing instance of the influence exerted on a composer by his
      immediate surroundings. After a very <span class="side">THE MESSMERS&mdash;RIGHINI.</span>

      cheerful first part, a plaintive tone is struck in the second, and a very
      strongly accentuated musical dialogue occurs. The names of the two sisters
      Weber are written against the characterising phrases of the music:&mdash;[See

    </p>
    <p>
      The Messmer family had offered Mozart apartments in their house in the
      suburbs, but he could not make up his mind to accept the offer: "The house
      is not what it was," he writes to his sister (December 15, 1781). Messmer
      had staying with him at the time Vine. Righini (1756-1812), formerly an
      opera-buffa singer and then a composer; they were on very intimate terms,
      and Madame Messmer was especially friendly to Righini. The latter, as
      Mozart informs his father in answer to his inquiries, makes a great deal
      of money by giving lessons, and his cantata (probably "Il Natale d'
      Apollo") had been given twice during Lent with great success. "He writes
      <i>prettily</i>; is not superficial, but a great thief. He gives back his
      stolen goods so unblushingly and in such overflowing abundance that people
      can hardly digest them" (August 29, 1781).<a href="#linknote-26002"

      Another musical family would have been glad to receive him as an inmate,
      and his father appears to have been not unwilling that he should form a
      closer connection in this case. Wolfgang had been introduced to Herr
      Aurnhammer, whose "fat lady-daughter" Josephine was considered one of the
      first clavier-players of the day. They received him kindly, and often
      invited him, as he informs his father (June 27, 1781): "I dine almost
      daily with Herr Aurnhammer; the young lady is a horror&mdash;but she plays
      divinely; she seems <span class="side">COURTSHIP.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p252.png">[252]</a></span> to lose her
      really refined taste in singing, however, and drags everything."<a

      It would have been convenient to them that Mozart should be in their
      immediate neighbourhood. But he was far from satisfied with the quarters
      which they offered him; it was a room "for rats and mice, but not for
      human beings. The stairs need a lantern to light them at noonday; and the
      room might be called a <i>cell.</i> The wife herself called the house a
      rat's nest&mdash;in fact it was really dreadful." Nor did he feel any
      inclination for closer intercourse with this family, whose motives in
      wishing for him he believed that he saw through. Seeing that his father
      had set his mind upon his going, he felt constrained to set the two sides
      of the question before him. The description which follows is somewhat
      "schlimm" certainly, but too characteristic of the writer to be omitted:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is the best-natured man in the world; too much so, indeed, for his wife&mdash;a
      stupid, silly chatterer&mdash;has quite the upper hand, so that when she
      speaks he has not a word to say. Whenever we go for a walk together he
      begs me not to mention in his wife's presence that we took a fiacre or
      drank some beer. Now I cannot possibly have confidence in such a man. He
      is a good fellow and my very good friend, and I can dine with him when I
      please, but I am not used to be paid for <i>my civilities</i>; indeed a
      dinner would scarcely be fitting payment, but people like these think so
      much of what they do. I will not attempt to describe the mother to you;
      one has enough to do at table to refrain from laughing at her. You know
      Frau Adlgasser? This creature is worse, for she is ill-natured as well as
      stupid. As for the daughter, if a painter wanted a model for the evil one
      he might have recourse to her face. She is as fat as a peasant-girl, and
      once seeing her is enough to make one wretched for the whole day. <i>Pfui
      Teufel!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote to you how she plays the clavier, and why she begged me to assist
      her.<a href="#linknote-26004" name="linknoteref-26004"
      id="linknoteref-26004"> 4 </a> She is not content that I should pass two
      hours every day <span class="side">JOSEPHINE AURNHAMMER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p253.png">[253]</a></span> with her, she
      would like me to spend the whole day there, and then she makes herself
      agreeable! or rather, worse than that, she is seriously in love with me. I
      thought it was a joke, but I know it for certain now. When I first
      observed it (for she took liberties, reproaching me for coming later than
      usual, or not staying long enough, and other such things) I felt
      constrained to tell her the truth politely, for fear she should make a
      fool of herself. But it was of no use, she became more deeply in love.
      Then I tried being very polite until she began her nonsense, when I turned
      cross. Then she took me by the hand and said, "Dear Mozart, do not be so
      angry, and you may say what you like, I am so fond of you." It was the
      talk of the whole town that we were going to be married, and people
      wondered at my choice. She told me that when anything of the kind was said
      to her, she laughed at it; but I know from a certain person that she
      acknowledged it, with the addition that we should set out on our travels
      together as soon as we were married. That made me really angry. I gave her
      my true opinion on the subject, and reproached her with abusing my
      kindness. I have left off going there every day, and only go every other
      day, so as to break it off by degrees. She is an infatuated fool. Before
      she knew me, she said when she heard me at the theatre, "He is coming to
      me to-morrow, and I shall play him his variations in the same style." For
      this very reason I did not go. It was a conceited speech, and an untrue
      one, for I had had no intention of going there the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this did not prevent Mozart from assisting Fraulein Aurnhammer in his
      usual amiable manner. At a concert at Aurnhammer's (November 24, 1781) he
      played the Concerto a due (365 K.) with her, and a sonata which was
      composed expressly, and "went remarkably well" (381 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later he played a duet with her at one of his own concerts
      (May 25,1782), and postponed a journey to Salzburg because he had promised
      to play at her concert in the theatre (October 26, 1782). He also
      dedicated to her the sonatas for piano and violin which appeared in 1781
      (376-380 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In September he actually found a new lodging, but he was far from
      comfortable there; "it was like travelling in a post-chaise instead of
      one's own carriage." He had made <span class="side">COURTSHIP.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p254.png">[254]</a></span> the
      sacrifice for his father's sake, and he now took occasion to beg the
      latter not to listen to gossip, but to believe that he meant "to remain
      the same honest fellow as ever" (September 5, 1781). But the discomfort of
      his domestic circumstances in the midst of incessant work only increased
      his desire to set up an establishment of his own. The gossip of the town
      and his father's exhortations had produced a contrary effect to that
      intended, and his liking for Constanze Weber grew more decided day by day.
      He felt persuaded that she would make him happy, and, since she returned
      his affection, they became betrothed lovers. He could not disguise from
      himself that his father would certainly disapprove of this step, and he
      laid before him with great candour all that had led to it. After setting
      forth his prospects of an assured position, and the steps which he had
      taken towards obtaining it, he continues (December 15, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My desire is to have something certain to fall back upon, and then one can
      live very well on chance here&mdash;and to get married. Nature speaks as
      loud in me as in any other, perhaps louder than in a great heavy
      blockhead. I have no inclination to live like most young men of the
      present day. In the first place I have too much love for religion, and in
      the second too much love for my neighbour, and too much good feeling to
      lead astray an innocent girl. I can take my oath I have never done so. But
      I know that this reason, strong as it is, is not elevated enough. But my
      temperament, which is inclined for a quiet domestic life &mdash;my want of
      habit of attending to my clothing, washing, and other such things&mdash;make
      a wife indispensable to me. I am quite persuaded that I could live better
      on the same income with a wife than as I am now. And how many unnecessary
      expenses would be done away with, others would arise; but one knows them
      and can calculate on them&mdash;in fact, one leads a regular life. An
      unmarried man only half lives, in my opinion. That is my opinion&mdash;I
      cannot help it; I have reflected and considered enough, and have quite
      made up my mind. But who, you will ask, is the object of my love? Do not
      be horrified, I beg. What! not a Weber! Yes, a Weber; not Josepha, nor
      Sophia, but Constanze, the middle one. I have never seen such
      dissimilarity of mind in any family as in this. The eldest, Josepha, is
      lazy and cross; Aloysia Lange is a false, unprincipled woman and a
      coquette; the youngest, Sophie, is too young to be anything yet but the
      good thoughtless creature she is. God keep her from temptation! But the
      middle one, my dear good Constanze, is the martyr of the family, and on
      that very account, perhaps, the best-natured, the cleverest&mdash;in a
      word, the best of them all. She looks after everything in the house, and
      yet can never <span class="side">BETROTHAL WITH CONSTANZE WEBER.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p255.png">[255]</a></span> do
      right. She is not ugly, but she is far from being beautiful. Her whole
      beauty consists in her dark eyes and good figure. She is not intellectual,
      but has common sense enough to fulfil her duties as a wife and mother. She
      is not inclined to extravagance, that is quite untrue; on the contrary,
      she is always badly dressed, for the little her mother can do is done for
      the two others, never for her. True, she likes to be neat and clean, but
      not smart; and almost all that a woman needs she can make for herself; she
      understands housekeeping, has the best heart in the world&mdash;she loves
      me and I love her&mdash;tell me if I could wish for a better wife? I must
      tell you that when I wrote before love was not there, but was born of her
      tender care and attention when I was living in the house. My earnest wish
      now is to get something settled to do (of which, God be praised, I have
      great hope), and I shall then hasten to beg your permission to rescue my
      poor darling, and make her and myself&mdash;indeed, I may say, all of us&mdash;happy,
      for does not my being happy render you so?
    </p>
    <p>
      This confirmation of the news which had already reached him from other
      quarters was a heavy blow to L. Mozart. The perspective of "dying on a
      sack of straw in a room full of starving brats" which he had once before
      held out to his son (Vol. I., p. 426) opened itself to him anew; marriage
      without a certain and sufficient income was, in his opinion, and knowing
      his son as he did, the first step to certain ruin. And then the Weber
      family! The description which Wolf-gang gave of them was not calculated to
      inspire confidence; if he had been so completely deceived in Aloysia, who
      could answer for his better judgment with respect to Constanze? But his
      father knew more than he had learnt from Wolfgang; he knew that the latter
      had given a written promise of marriage, and, from all the communications
      he received, he could not but believe that both mother and daughter had
      been playing upon the young man's inexperience and sense of honour to
      entice him into their net. L. Mozart sought by every means in his power to
      influence his son; he demanded information as to the written agreement,
      that he might be satisfied that it did not exist, and that Wolfgang was
      bound only by his word. But Wolfgang showed himself firmer and more
      independent at this juncture than ever before; he had made up his mind,
      and it was not to be shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hesitate to explain the circumstances of the <span class="side">COURTSHIP.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p256.png">[256]</a></span>
      marriage contract (December 22, 1781). After the death of their father,
      the Weber children had been placed under the guardianship of Johann
      Thorwarth, court manager and inspector of the theatrical wardrobe, a man
      of considerable influence in matters theatrical, and well thought of by
      Count Rosenberg and Baron Kienmayer&mdash;"a sworn enemy of the Italians."<a
      href="#linknote-26005" name="linknoteref-26005" id="linknoteref-26005"> 5
      </a> This man had been prejudiced against Mozart by calumniators, who
      represented that he had no certain income, and that he did not mean
      honestly by Constanze; this so disturbed the mother that she did not rest
      until she had induced Mozart to request an interview with the guardian.
      The interview took place, but the guardian was so little satisfied that he
      insisted on all intercourse with Mozart being broken off unless he would
      agree to a written contract. Madame Weber declared that this could not be;
      that all the intercourse consisted in Mozart's coming daily to their
      house, and that she could not possibly put a stop to it, seeing that she
      was under much obligation to him as a friend, and that she placed every
      confidence in his truth and honour; if the guardian thought such a step
      necessary, he must undertake it himself. Hereupon Thorwarth prohibited all
      intercourse unless Mozart would give a written agreement. He must make his
      choice. Having no intention of giving up Constanze or affording ground for
      suspicion to her friends, he signed an agreement by virtue of which he
      bound himself to espouse Mdlle. Constanze Weber within three years, or "in
      case of such an impossibility as his changing his mind," he was to pay her
      three hundred florins a year. He assured his father that there was no sort
      of risk in this, as he was finally resolved never to forsake her; but if
      such an unheard-of event were to occur, he would think himself easily
      bought off with three hundred florins; besides that his Constanze would,
      he knew, be far too proud to accept a price. "And what did the devoted
      girl do?" he continues; "as soon as the guardian had gone, she took the
      agreement from her mother, tore it up, and said: 'Dear Mozart, I need no
      written assurance <span class="side">SLANDEROUS REPORTS IN SALZBURG.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p257.png">[257]</a></span> from
      you; I can believe your simple word!'" It was thought best by them all to
      keep this transaction secret; but it gradually oozed out, until all Vienna
      knew of it. It might be wrong, and this part of the affair was blameable&mdash;thus
      much he acknowledged to his father; but neither the guardian nor the
      mother deserved to be branded as misleaders of youthful innocence; it was
      a falsehood that they had made him free of the house and then bound him in
      spite of himself&mdash;it was quite the contrary, and he would have known
      better than to give in to such conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      His indignation was raised to the highest pitch when he heard from his
      father that the most disgraceful falsehoods as to his dealings with
      Constanze had reached Salzburg by way of Munich, and were attributable to
      "that scoundrel" Winter, who had always hated him on Vogler's account.<a
      href="#linknote-26006" name="linknoteref-26006" id="linknoteref-26006"> 6
      </a> Winter had been staying in Vienna with the bassoonist Reiner, and
      Mozart had sought him out as an old acquaintance. It was all the more
      infamous, since this very Winter, who "deserved the name neither of a man
      nor a human being," and to whose "infamous lies" Mozart would not
      condescend to oppose "infamous truths," had once said to him: "You will be
      foolish to marry; you can earn enough&mdash;why should you not keep a
      mistress? What prevents you? Is it your d&mdash;&mdash;d religion?"
      (December 22, 1781).
    </p>
    <p>
      But against such calumnies he was powerless. "My maxim is," he says
      (January 9, 1782), "that what does not concern me is not worth the trouble
      of talking about; I am ashamed to defend myself from false accusations,
      for I always think that the truth is sure to come to light." He therefore
      refused to stir in the matter, and left free course to all the falsehood
      and misrepresentation.

    <p>
      <span class="side">COURTSHIP.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart was naturally not much reassured by this explanation. He called
      his son's attention to Madame Weber's failings, which rendered a good
      education of her daughters very unlikely, and Wolfgang could not deny
      (April 10, 1782) that "she is fond of drink, and takes more than a woman
      should. But I have never seen her intoxicated; I can quite deny that. The
      children drink nothing but water." His father further pointed out that she
      would certainly be a burden on him after his marriage, and that she made
      no secret of her intentions in this respect. Wolfgang could not but
      perceive for himself that the mother was seeking her own advantage in the
      marriage of her daughter (January 30, 1782), "but she will find herself
      very much mistaken. She wished us (when we were married) to lodge with her&mdash;but
      that will come to nothing, for I would never agree to it, and Constanze
      still less. <i>Au contraire</i>, she intends to see very little of her
      mother, and I shall do my utmost to prevent it&mdash;we know her." But
      Wolfgang was deeply wounded at his father's depreciation of Constanze
      herself (January 30,1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one thing more (and without saying it I could not sleep quietly)
      &mdash;do not ascribe such motives to my dear Constanze; believe me, I
      could not love her as I do if she deserved your censure. My dear, good
      father, I only wish that we may soon meet; for that you will love her, as
      you love all true hearts, I know for certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained proof against all his father's remonstrances (January 9,
      1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot be happy without my beloved Constanze, and I should be only half
      happy without your consent; make me quite happy then, my dearest, best of
      fathers!
    </p>
    <p>
      He confided to his sister (whom he had befriended in her own need) what he
      and Constanze had to suffer from her mother's temper. He used to work
      until nine o'clock in the evening, he writes (February 13, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I go to my beloved Constanze; but our pleasure in being together
      is often embittered by her mother's angry tongue, as I shall explain to my
      father in my next letter, and make it the ground of my wish to liberate
      and rescue her as soon as possible. I go home at half-past ten or eleven;
      it depends upon her mother's powers of holding out, or mine of resisting.

      Constanze, at Wolfgang's instigation, sought to gain his sister's
      affection by many little acts of attention; she sent her caps made by
      herself after the latest Vienna fashion, and on another occasion a little
      cross of no great value, but of a kind very much worn in Vienna; and
      again, a heart with an arrow that Wolfgang thought particularly
      appropriate to his sister (March 23, 1782). She "took courage at last" in
      a letter (April 20,1782), "to petition for her friendship as sister of her
      very worthy brother;" she felt that "she half deserved it already, and
      would try to deserve it altogether," as well as to gain the good opinion
      of the father of them both. Both the lovers were delighted at the
      favourable reception of these overtures, although the father's views were
      not thereby anywise altered. He was especially against any idea of
      marriage before Wolfgang had some secure means of livelihood, and in spite
      of many attempts and tedious negotiations there did not seem much
      likelihood of this at present. "If I could only have it in writing from
      'der liebe Gott," he writes to his father (January 23, 1782), "that I
      should continue in good health and never be ill, oh, would I not marry my
      dear, faithful sweetheart this very day!" His three pupils brought him
      eighteen ducats a month; if he could only get one more it would make 102
      florins 24 kreutzers, on which he and his wife could maintain themselves
      "quietly and plainly, as we wish to live." In case of sickness, indeed,
      his income would cease altogether; but he could write an opera once a
      year, give a concert, publish some compositions, or raise subscriptions
      for them; accidents could not always be taken into account. "But," he
      concludes, "if we cannot succeed we must just fail, and I would rather we
      did so together than wait any longer. I cannot be worse off&mdash;things
      must improve with me. My reasons for not waiting any longer are not so
      much on my own account, as on hers. I must release her as soon as
      possible." The father did not grant the urgent necessity, and seeing in
      Wolfgang's calculations on the possibilities of an uncertain future a sure
      proof that he had not yet learnt what the foundation of a well-ordered
      household should be, he persisted in his refusal to consent to an
      immediate marriage.

      Difficult as Mozart's position was rendered by the displeasure of his
      father and the ill-temper of Frau Weber, his beloved Constanze herself did
      not always improve matters; the violence of her feelings sometimes put his
      constancy to the trial, and added to his perplexities. The lovers'
      quarrels soon blew over, but Mozart's position became daily more
      insupportable as his affairs became known and talked of. Even the Emperor,
      who felt a warm interest in the family affairs of the artists who had
      access to him,<a href="#linknote-26007" name="linknoteref-26007"
      id="linknoteref-26007"> 7 </a> had expressed himself graciously as to
      Mozart's marriage when the latter played before him with Clementi; his
      condescension raised hopes which were not destined to be fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the success of his opera had directed public attention towards him,
      the curiosity as to his relations with Constanze became still more
      general. "What are we to do?" he writes mournfully to his father (July 27,
      1782). "Most people believe that we are married already: the mother is
      wild about it, and the poor girl and myself are tormented to death." The
      earnest tone of mind in which he passed through this time of trial is
      illustrated in a later letter to his father (August 17, 1782), where he
      says that he has long since heard mass and confessed with Constanze, "and
      I found that I never prayed so heartily or confessed and communicated so
      devoutly as by her side. She felt the same, and it would really seem that
      we are made for each other, and that God, who orders all things, has
      ordained our union also, and will not forsake us."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture a distinguished musical patroness espoused the cause of
      the lovers. The Baroness von WaldstÃ¤dten, famous as a clavier-player as
      early as the year 1766,<a href="#linknote-26008" name="linknoteref-26008"
      id="linknoteref-26008"> 8 </a> was one of the ladies who had taken Mozart
      under their protection from his first arrival, and interesting herself,
      womanlike, as much in his affairs of the heart as in his musical
      performances, she sought by every means in her power to bring his
      relations with Constanze to a happy
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">FRIENDSHIP OF THE BARONESS V. WALDSTÃ„DTEN</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p261.png">[261]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      conclusion. In order to withdraw Constanze from the tyranny of her mother,
      and to facilitate Wolfgang's intercourse with his betrothed, she took the
      latter more than once for a considerable time into her own house in the
      Leopold Strasse. There were, indeed, reasons which rendered this intimacy
      undesirable. The Baroness had led an unhappy life, and sought to indemnify
      herself for it by indulgence in the frivolous habits then only too
      frequent among the higher ranks of society; her reputation was not of the
      best. Mozart knew this, as all Vienna knew it; he had reason to dread the
      influence of such a friendship for Constanze, but he was convinced that
      the Baroness meant well by them both, and he felt that he had no resource
      but to accept her help, and to be very grateful for it. But Constanze's
      mother had at least some show of right in forbidding her daughter to
      continue in communication with the Baroness, and, fearful lest she should
      be taken altogether out of her power, she endeavoured to force her to
      return home. An undated letter, addressed in great tribulation to the
      Baroness, gives us full insight into Mozart's trying circumstances:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Most honoured Baroness,&mdash;I received my music by the hands of Madame
      Weber's maid, and was obliged to give a written receipt for it. The
      servant confided to me what, if true, is a lasting disgrace to the whole
      family; I can only believe it from my knowledge of Madame Weber's
      character, and it afflicts me greatly. Sophie had come out weeping, and
      when her maid asked her the cause of her tears, she said: "Tell Mozart in
      secret that Constanze had better return home, for my mother insists upon
      sending the police for her." But surely the police would not dare thus to
      enter any house. Perhaps it is only a ruse to get her home again. If this
      threat is really fulfilled, I see nothing for it but to marry my Constanze
      early to-morrow, or, if it can be done, to-day; for I would not allow of
      this affront to my beloved, and it could not happen to my wife. Another
      thing: Thorwarth was appointed to his place to-day. I beg your ladyship to
      give me your kind advice, and to render us poor creatures all the
      assistance you can. I am always at home. In the greatest haste. Constanze
      knows nothing of all this. Has Herr von Thorwarth waited on your ladyship
      already? Is it necessary that we should both go to him after dinner
      to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances Mozart was ready to espouse his Constanze
      without a moment's delay; he reiterates his entreaties for his father's
      consent (July 31, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">COURTSHIP.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p262.png">[262]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have received my last letter by this time, and I have no doubt
      that your next will bring your consent to our union. You can have nothing
      really to object to in it, and your letters show that you have not; for
      she is a good honest girl, and I am in a position to provide her with
      bread. We love each other and wish for each other, so there is no reason
      for delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his father still withheld his consent. He was so deeply affected by
      the affair that he scarcely took proper interest in the success of the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung," and Wolfgang complained of the coolness with which his
      father received his opera. The latter retorted that he was making himself
      detested in Vienna by his arrogant manners. Wolfgang answered (July 31,
      1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the whole world declares that my boasting and criticising have made
      enemies for me of all the professors of music and others. What world?
      Presumably the Salzburg world; for whoever was here would hear and see
      enough to the contrary: and that shall be my answer to the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness WaldstÃ¤dten had in the meantime (by what means we know not)
      smoothed away all difficulties, and the wedding was celebrated on August
      4, before the arrival of the father's formal consent, for which they had
      waited two post-days. Wolfgang's conviction that the consent could not now
      be withheld was justified;<a href="#linknote-26009"
      name="linknoteref-26009" id="linknoteref-26009"> 9 </a> on the day after
      the wedding the longed-for letters from the father and sister arrived, and
      Wolfgang answered in his overflowing happiness (August 7, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I kiss your hand, and thank you with all the tenderness which a son can
      feel for his father for your very kind consent and paternal blessing. My
      dear wife will write by the next post to beg our best of fathers for his
      blessing, and our beloved sister for the continuance of her valued
      friendship. There was no one present at the ceremony except the mother and
      the youngest sister, Herr von Thorwarth as guardian and supporter
      (Beistand) to us both, Herr Landrath von Cetto supporting, the bride, and
      Gilowsky supporting me. When we were actually united <span class="side">MOZART'S
      MARRIAGE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p263.png">[263]</a></span>
      my wife and I both began to weep. Every one, including the officiating
      priest, was moved to tears by the sight of our happiness. Our wedding
      festivities consisted solely in a supper given us by the Baroness von
      WaldstÃ¤dten, which was rather princely than baronial.<a
      href="#linknote-260010" name="linknoteref-260010" id="linknoteref-260010">
      10 </a> Now my dearest Constanze is rejoicing in the thought of a journey
      to Salzburg, and I wager&mdash;yes&mdash;I will wager that you will be
      happy in my happiness when you have learnt to know her, as I do, for the
      most upright, virtuous, and loving wife that ever made the happiness of a
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father considered it necessary to draw attention to the fact that he
      could no longer expect Wolfgang to assist in extricating him from the
      debts he had incurred on his son's behalf; on the other hand, Wolfgang
      must neither now nor at any future time reckon upon him for support; and
      he begged him to make his bride fully aware of this circumstance. Mozart
      answered (August 7, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Constanze&mdash;now, thank God, my own lawful wife&mdash;has long
      known my circumstances and all that I have to expect from you. But her
      friendship and her love for me were so great that she willingly sacrificed
      her whole future life to my destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Mozart's courtship, such was his "EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Auge
      Gottes," as he used jokingly to call his marriage, because the house in
      which Madame Weber lived on the Petersplatz was called "Zum Auge Gottes."
      Truly this time brought him none of the peaceful happiness which the
      certainty of mutual love bestows under more prosperous circumstances, but
      it afforded him abundant opportunity for the display of his freedom as an
      artist, and of his inflexible constancy to what he thought true and right.
      Unaffected by the vulgarity from the atmosphere of which he had resolved
      upon rescuing his Constanze, unchanged by the violence and hastiness of
      his beloved herself, unmoved by the hard and often unjust judgment of his
      father, he preserved both the firmness of his conviction and will, and the
      tender susceptibility and charm of his affectionate heart. The mental and
      moral development of every man depends in no small <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p264.png">[264]</a></span>degree upon whether his
      course of life has been smooth and his happiness easy of attainment, or
      whether he has obtained the conditions of his existence only after a long
      and severe struggle. We must not, therefore, turn aside our glance from
      the trials and troubles which have beset the lives of great artists and
      noble men; it was through adversity that they became what they were.

      CHAPTER XXVII. MARRIED LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE newly married couple began their housekeeping upon an uncertain and
      barely sufficing income, <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p264.png">[264]</a></span> and so it
      remained to the end. Limited means, sometimes even actual want, failed
      either to increase the carefulness or to damp the spirits of husband or
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's sincere and upright love for his wife has been clearly
      demonstrated already; it was the talk of Vienna. One day, soon after his
      marriage, as he and his wife were walking in the public gardens, they
      amused themselves by playing with her little pet dog. Constanze told
      Mozart to make believe to beat her, in order to see the indignation of the
      dog. As he was doing so, the Emperor came out of his summerhouse and said,
      "What! only three weeks married, and come to blows already!" whereupon
      Mozart laughingly explained the joke. Later, in 1785, when there was much
      talk, even in the newspapers, of the unhappy relations between Aloysia
      Lange and her husband,<a href="#linknote-27001" name="linknoteref-27001"
      id="linknoteref-27001"> 1 </a> the Emperor met Constanze Mozart, and said,
      after some remark on the sad position of her sister: "What a difference it
      makes, to have a good husband!"<a href="#linknote-27002"
      name="linknoteref-27002" id="linknoteref-27002"> 2 </a> At about the same
      time the English tenor, Kelly, was introduced at a musical party to Mozart
      and his wife, "whom he loved passionately."<a href="#linknote-27003"
      name="linknoteref-27003" id="linknoteref-27003"> 3 </a> His affection
      betrays itself in many amiable <span class="side">CONSTANZE MOZART.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p265.png">[265]</a></span> traits,
      and most clearly in the letters addressed to his wife on his later
      journeys, to which she herself expressly appeals as proofs of his "rare
      affection and excessive tenderness for her."<a href="#linknote-27004"
      name="linknoteref-27004" id="linknoteref-27004"> 4 </a> An expression of
      Nissen's that Constanze cared "perhaps more for his talent than himself"
      might lead to a belief that his love was not returned in full measure; but
      against this view we have the testimony of worthy Niemet-schek, who knew
      them both, and says: "Mozart was happy in his union with Constanze Weber.
      She made him a good, loving wife, who accommodated herself admirably to
      his ways, and gained his full confidence and a power over him which she
      often used to restrain him from rash actions. He loved her sincerely,
      confided all to her, even his faults, and she rewarded him with tenderness
      and faithful care. All Vienna knew of their mutual affection, and the
      widow can never think without emotion of her days of wedded life."
      Constanze had, as Mozart had written before their marriage, "not much
      intellect, but enough common sense to fulfil her duties as a wife and
      mother." It can, indeed, be gathered from contemporary letters and notices<a
      href="#linknote-27005" name="linknoteref-27005" id="linknoteref-27005"> 5
      </a> that she had neither <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p266.png">[266]</a></span> natural
      capacity nor what we call education enough to render her on an equality
      with Mozart, or to elevate him by her intellectual influence; nay, rather,
      she failed fully to appreciate or understand him. Like all the Weber
      family, she had musical talent, which had been cultivated up to a certain
      point. "She played the clavier and sang nicely."<a href="#linknote-27006"
      name="linknoteref-27006" id="linknoteref-27006"> 6 </a> At the Mozarteum,
      in Salzburg, there is the commencement of a "Sonata Ã¤ deux Cembali,"
      unfinished, with the superscription "Per la Signora Constanza Weber&mdash;ah!"
      A sonata for pianoforte and violin, in C major, which only wants the
      concluding bars of the last movement (403 K.), belonging to the year 1782,
      is inscribed "Sonate PremiÃ¨re, par moi, W. A. Mozart, pour ma trÃ¨s chÃ¨re
      Ã©pouse." In a letter to HÃ¤rtel (February 25, 1799), the widow mentions a
      march for the piano which her husband had composed for her. Although her
      voice was not so fine as those of her sisters Aloysia and Josepha, she
      sang very well, especially by sight, so that Mozart used to try his
      compositions with her. Solfeggi by Mozart are preserved, with the
      inscription&mdash;"Per la mia cara Constanze," or "Per la mia cara
      consorte" (393 K.), some of them exercises of a few bars' length, others
      elaborate passages in varied tempo and style, which give abundant practice
      for execution and delivery. There is a song also&mdash;"In te spero o
      sposo amato," (Metastasio, "Demofoonte"), mentioned by the widow in a
      letter to HÃ¤rtel (February 25, 1799), as composed "per la cara mia
      consorte," which implies a compass and volubility reminding us of her
      sister Aloysia. It was natural, therefore, that Constanze should take the
      soprano parts in any private performances among their friends, and we know
      that she once sang the soprano soli of the Mass in C minor (427 K.) at
      Salzburg, which require a first-rate singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must also give her credit for more than ordinary musical taste and
      cultivation, from her partiality for fugues, of which Mozart writes to his
      sister (April 20, 1782), when he sent her a prelude and fugue (394 K.),
      which he had composed for her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">CONSTANZE'S SYMPATHY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p267.png">[267]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of this fugue coming into the world is in reality my dear
      Constanze. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, allowed me to
      take home all the works of Handel and Sebastian Bach, after I had played
      them to him. When Constanze heard the fugues, she quite fell in love with
      them; she cares for nothing but fugues now, especially those of Handel and
      Bach. Having often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I
      had never written any down? and when I said no, she scolded me roundly for
      not writing the most artistic and beautiful things in music; she would not
      leave me any peace until I had written down a fugue, and so it came to
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart would hardly have been happy with a wife who possessed neither
      taste nor understanding for music. But neither would his creative power
      have been strengthened by an intellectually excitable and exciting wife;
      it was far more beneficial for him to find womanly sympathy in his
      household affairs, and to be soothed rather than urged to greater efforts.
      She patiently bore his abstraction when his mind was intent upon musical
      ideas, and gave in to many little whims, which in Mozart seldom proceeded
      from ill-temper. He was never disturbed by the conversation and noise
      going on around him when he was writing down his compositions; it was
      rather agreeable to him to have his attention so far occupied in other
      directions that his excessive productivity was held, as it were, in check.
      His wife would sit by him and tell him stories and nursery tales, over
      which he would laugh heartily, working all the time; the more ludicrous
      they were the better he was pleased.<a href="#linknote-27007"
      name="linknoteref-27007" id="linknoteref-27007"> 7 </a> She was always
      ready to cut up his meat for him at table, an operation which he tried to
      avoid, lest in his abstraction he should do himself an injury<a
      href="#linknote-27008" name="linknoteref-27008" id="linknoteref-27008"> 8
      </a>&mdash;an oddity which is only mentioned as a proof how much of a
      child Mozart always remained in many of the ways of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was severely tried by his wife's delicacy; her health was undermined by
      frequent and often dangerous confinements, and she was often, especially
      in the year 1789, for many months in a critical condition. He bestowed the
      tenderest care upon her, and spared nothing that was likely to benefit
      <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p268.png">[268]</a></span> her, even when the remedy
      proposed (as for instance, repeated visits to Baden for some years) was a
      severe tax upon his slender resources. Instances of liberality like that
      displayed to him on one occasion of his wife's illness by a comparative
      stranger were few and far between. A certain honest tripe-boiler, Rindum
      by name, who knew nothing of Mozart personally, but who delighted in his
      musiÃ§, heard that his wife, suffering from lameness, had been ordered
      footbaths of the water in which tripe had been cooked; he begged her to go
      to his house for them as often as she pleased, and at the termination of
      the cure he could not be induced to accept any payment either for them or
      for board and lodging during a considerable time.<a href="#linknote-27009"
      name="linknoteref-27009" id="linknoteref-27009"> 9 </a> As for Mozart
      himself, the care that he bestowed upon her was tender and loving to an
      uncommon degree. He used to ride every morning at five o'clock, but he
      never went without leaving a paper in the form of a prescription upon his
      wife's bed, with some directions of this kind:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good morning, my darling wife, I hope that you have slept well, and that

      The tenderest anxiety for his wife's health is expressed in his letters,
      and he especially cautions her to spare her weak foot. Frau Haibl (Sophie
      Weber) narrates:<a href="#linknote-270011" name="linknoteref-270011"

      How troubled Mozart was when anything ailed his dear little wife! On one
      occasion she had been ill for fully eight months, and I had nursed her. I
      was sitting by her bed, and so was Mozart. He was composing, and I was
      watching the sleep into which she had at last fallen; we were as quiet as
      the grave for fear of disturbing her. A rough maidservant came suddenly
      into the room. Mozart, fearing that his wife would be awakened, wished to
      beckon for silence, and pushed his chair backwards with an open knife in
      his hand. The knife struck between his chair and his thigh, and went
      almost up to the handle in his flesh. Mozart was usually very susceptible
      of pain, but now he controlled <span class="side">ILLNESS OF MOZART'S
      WIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p269.png">[269]</a></span>
      himself, and made no sign of pain, but beckoned me to follow him out of
      the room. We went into another room, in which our good mother was
      concealed, because we did not wish Mozart to know how ill his wife was,
      and yet the mother's presence was necessary in case of emergency. She
      bound the wound and cured it with healing oil. He went lame for some time,
      but took care that his wife should know nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became so accustomed during this long illness to receive every visitor
      with his finger on his lip, and the low exclamation "Chut!" that even some
      time after her recovery, when he saw an acquaintance in the street, he
      would walk on tiptoe, and whisper "Chut!" with his finger on his lip.<a
      href="#linknote-270012" name="linknoteref-270012" id="linknoteref-270012">
      12 </a> The contemplation of such deep-seated affection as this causes us
      to be more surprised to hear that Mozart, whose unmarried life had been
      without a blemish, was, nevertheless, unfaithful to his wife. She told
      herself how Mozart acknowledged his indiscretions to her, and how she
      forgave him: "He was so good, it was impossible to be angry with him; one
      was obliged to forgive him." Her sister, however, betrays that Constanze
      was not always so patient, and that there were occasional violent
      outbreaks, which is quite conceivable; but it is also abundantly evident
      (and Mozart's letters to his wife fully confirm the fact) that the close
      and tender relations of each to the other were not seriously disturbed by
      these failings.<a href="#linknote-270013" name="linknoteref-270013"
      id="linknoteref-270013"> 13 </a> They might on this account alone be
      lightly dismissed, and in addition it must be remembered that rumour was
      busy among the public and in the press, and magnified solitary instances
      of weakness on Mozart's part into distinguishing features of his
      character. He was credited with intrigues with every pupil he had, and
      every singer for whom he wrote a song; it was considered a witty remark to
      designate him as the actual prototype of his Don Juan; and his dissipated
      life was even considered as the proper confirmation of his artistic
      genius. Exceptional gifts and accomplishments cannot do away with the
      equality of all men before the moral law; transgressions of the moral law
      may be judged leniently or severely, as the case may be, <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p270.png">[270]</a></span>
      but weaknesses, which in ordinary men are judged lightly, or passed over
      altogether, must not be measured by another standard, or made the sign of
      complete moral degradation when they are committed by an artist and a
      genius whose very faults interest us more than the virtues of other men.
      Nor should implicit confidence be placed in the gossip and chatter which
      surround this side of a great man's private life, and turn errors into
      crimes. The free and easy manners and ideas of the day, which found
      special favour in Vienna,<a href="#linknote-270014"
      name="linknoteref-270014" id="linknoteref-270014"> 14 </a> the peculiar
      temptations to which an artist's temperament and mode of life expose him,
      make Mozart's failings conceivable. If it be remembered further how
      imprudently Mozart behaved, how professional envy and meanness designedly
      tarnished his fame, it will be readily conceded that better grounds for a
      fair estimate of Mozart's character are to be found in numerous
      well-authenticated and consistent instances of his true nobility of mind
      than in idle and malicious gossip. The earnest spirit in which he looked
      upon these things is well displayed in a letter to his best and dearest
      friend, Gottfried von Jacquin (Prague, November 4,1787):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my dear friend, how are you? I hope that you are all as hale and
      hearty as we are; you cannot but be content, dear friend, since you
      possess all that you can desire at your age and in your position;
      especially since you seem altogether to have renounced your former
      somewhat unsettled life. Do you not daily grow more convinced of the truth
      of my little lecture? Is not the pleasure of a fickle and capricious love
      a thousand times removed from the blessedness accompanying a sincere and
      rational affection? I am sure you often thank me in your heart for my
      advice! You will make me quite proud! But without a joke&mdash;you owe me
      a little gratitude if you have really made yourself worthy of FrÃ¤ulein N.,
      for I played no unimportant part in your improvement or reformation.

      Hummel, who was received into Mozart's house as his pupil, wrote in 1831,
      when he lay dying at Kissingen: "I declare it to be untrue that Mozart
      abandoned himself to excess, except on those rare occasions on which he
      was enticed by Schikaneder, which had chiefly to do with the
      "Zauberflote."<a href="#linknote-270015" name="linknoteref-270015"
      id="linknoteref-270015"> 15 </a> His intimacy with the notorious
      profligate Schikaneder during the summer of 1791, when his wife was an
      invalid at Baden, and the excesses to which he then gave way, have been
      magnified by report, and made the foundation of the exaggerated
      representation of Mozart's thoughtless life.<a href="#linknote-270016"
      name="linknoteref-270016" id="linknoteref-270016"> 16 </a> The further
      reproach brought against him of extravagance and bad management of his
      household must not be left altogether unnoticed, illiberal as it may seem
      to hold up for the examination of posterity the trivial cares of
      housekeeping and money-getting which, when ordinary mortals are concerned,
      are kept sacred within the four walls of the home. But this part of
      Mozart's life has been intruded so often into the foreground, that a
      concise statement of the facts belonging to it seems indispensable. By
      some his contemporaries have been condemned for allowing his mind to be
      hampered by unworthy cares, by others he has himself been reproved for
      having brought himself to poverty by thoughtless extravagance; both these
      views are exaggerated and in this sense unjust.

    <p>
      It is true that Mozart was not so highly esteemed in Vienna during his
      life as after his death. The general public admired him chiefly as a
      pianoforte-player, the downfall of German opera prevented his continuance
      along the successful path which his "EntfÃ¼hrung" had opened to him, and
      his Italian operas did not obtain so great a measure of <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p272.png">[272]</a></span>
      applause as the lighter ones of his contemporaries; when the "ZauberflÃ¶te"
      made its effect it was too late. It is scarcely surprising, therefore,
      that he failed to reach the position before the world which should by
      right have been his. But though it is easy for posterity to decide that
      Mozart had just claims to a place by the side of Gluck and above Bono,
      Salieri and Starzer, it must not be forgotten that his contemporaries had
      before them a young and struggling artist, and that those veterans had
      long been in possession of their distinguished places. Without laying too
      much stress upon the intrigues of opponents, or the Emperor's parsimony,
      it is plain that Mozart could not readily attain a position which had
      first to be created for him. He himself was encouraged by the brilliant
      success of the "EntfÃ¼hrung" and the universal applause which he received
      as a pianist to hope for a secure and respectable position, and he was
      bitterly disappointed that his good recommendations failed to procure him
      the post of teacher to the Princess Elizabeth. In his usual impulsive
      style he resolved on quitting Vienna at once, and wrote to his father
      (August 17, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vienna gentlemen (among whom the Emperor comes foremost) shall not
      imagine that I have nothing to do in the world outside Vienna. It is true
      that I would rather serve the Emperor than any other monarch, but I will
      never stoop to beg for any service. I believe myself to be in a position
      to do honour to any court. If Germany, my beloved fatherland, of which, as
      you know, I am proud, refuses me, then must France or England be the
      richer for a clever German&mdash;to the disgrace of the German nation. I
      need not tell you that the Germans have excelled other nations in almost
      every art&mdash;but where did the artists make their fortunes or their
      fame? Certainly not in Germany! Even Gluck&mdash;did Germany make him the
      great man he is? Alas, no! The Countess Thun, Count Zichy, Baron van
      Swieten, and Prince Kaunitz are all vexed with the Emperor for not
      encouraging men of talent to remain in his service. Prince Kaunitz said to
      the Archduke Maximilian, speaking of me, that such men only came into the
      world once in a hundred years, and ought not to be driven out of Germany,
      especially when the monarch is so fortunate as to possess them in his
      capital. You cannot think how kind and polite Prince Kaunitz was in an
      interview I had with him; he said when I took leave: "I am indebted to
      you, my dear Mozart, for taking the trouble of calling on me, &amp;c." You
      would not believe either how <span class="side">PLANS FOR SEEKING FORTUNE
      ABROAD.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p273.png">[273]</a></span>
      anxious the Countess Thun, Baron van Swieten, and other great people are
      to retain me here; but I cannot wait long, and <i>will</i> not wait on
      charity, as it were. Emperor though he be, I would rather dispense with
      his favours than accept them in such a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      His idea, as he let fall now and then in conversation, was to go to Paris
      for the following Lent. He wrote on the subject to Le Gros, and was of
      opinion that if he could only obtain engagements for the "Concert
      spirituel" and the "Concert des amateurs," he would have no lack of
      pupils, and could also do something in the way of composition; his main
      object would of course be an opera.<a href="#linknote-270017"
      name="linknoteref-270017" id="linknoteref-270017"> 17 </a> With this end
      in view he had been for some time studying the French language, and had
      also taken lessons in English, in the further expectation of making a tour
      in England; he thought he should understand the language fairly well in
      three months.<a href="#linknote-270018" name="linknoteref-270018"
      id="linknoteref-270018"> 18 </a> His father was not a little disturbed by
      this new idea; he opposed it with every argument he could find to his son,
      and even wrote on the subject to the Baroness von WaldstÃ¤dten (August 23,
      1782):<a href="#linknote-270019" name="linknoteref-270019"

      I should be quite reconciled (to the marriage), if I did not discover a
      great fault in my son: he is too indolent and easy-going, perhaps
      occasionally too proud, and all these qualities united make a man
      inactive; or else he grows impatient and cannot wait for anything. He is
      altogether ruled by opposite extremes&mdash;too much, or too little, and
      no medium. When he is in no pressing need he is quite content, and becomes
      indolent and inactive. Once set going, he is all on fire, and thinks he is
      going to make his fortune all at once. Nothing is allowed to stand in his
      way, and unfortunately it is just the cleverest people, the exceptional
      men of genius, who find continual obstacles in their path. What is there
      to prevent his having a prosperous career in Vienna, if he only has a
      little patience? Kapellmeister Bono is an aged man. Salieri will be
      promoted at his death, and will leave another place vacant. And is not
      Gluck also an old man? Honoured madam, exhort him to patience, and pardon
      me for asking the favour of your ladyship's opinion on the matter.

    <p>
      His remonstrances had the desired effect upon Wolfgang; he was obliged to
      acknowledge to his father (August 24, 1782) that it would be better to
      prolong his stay at Vienna; that he could go to France or England at any
      time. L. Mozart, reassured, wrote to the Baroness (September 13, 1782):
      "My son has relinquished his intention of leaving Vienna at present, in
      consequence of my letters; and as he now intends to visit me in Salzburg,
      I shall be able to make the strongest and most necessary representations
      to him on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      These representations were all the more effective since Mozart had at this
      juncture every reason to be satisfied with the sympathy and applause of
      the Vienna public. It is true that on the revival of Italian opera his
      works were excluded from the theatre; but in the year 1786 the Emperor
      proved that he had not forgotten him by commissioning him to compose the
      "Schauspieldirector" and "Figaro." But when Mozart, nevertheless, failed
      to obtain a permanent post, the idea again seriously presented itself of
      leaving Vienna and going to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Englishman named Thomas Attwood (1767-1838) had come from Italy to
      Vienna in the year 1785, and become Mozart's pupil. By a singular
      coincidence also the English tenor, Michael Kelly, and the English prima
      donna, Nancy Storace, were engaged at the Italian Opera. Stephen Storace,
      the brother, was also resident in Vienna as a composer for a considerable
      time. Mozart was on very friendly terms with them, and his design was
      thereby strengthened. At the beginning of November, 1786, he wrote to his
      father that he intended in the latter part of the Carnival to undertake a
      journey through Germany to England if his father would consent to receive
      and take charge of his two children and the servants. Constanze was to
      accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have written pretty strongly," L. Mozart informs his daughter (November
      17, 1786), "and promised to send him the continuation of my letter by the
      next post. It is not a bad idea, in truth. They may go away quietly&mdash;they
      may die&mdash;they may stay in England. Then I may run after them with the
      children; and as to the payment which he is to give <span class="side">L.
      MOZART'S DISAPPROBATION.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p275.png">[275]</a></span> me for the children and
      servants, &amp;c., Basta! My refusal is explicit and instructive, if he
      chooses to take it so." We see how prejudiced the once tender father had
      become against his son and his son's wife; whereas his daughter, who had
      married in 1784, came to his house to be confined, and he afterwards took
      entire charge of her son Leopold, a fact which he concealed from Wolfgang.
      Wolfgang's plan was given up immediately on receipt of this letter from
      his father. But when his English friend left Vienna at the beginning of
      February, 1787, and returned to England, the wish to accompany him rose
      strong in Mozart. He had become more prudent meanwhile. Attwood was to
      prepare a settled post for him in London, and to procure him a commission
      to write an opera or subscriptions for a concert, and then only he would
      come. He hoped that his father would in this case relieve him of the care
      of his children until he should have decided whether he would remain there
      permanently or return to Germany. The English travellers passed through
      Salzburg, and made L. Mozart's acquaintance, to their mutual satisfaction;<a
      href="#linknote-270020" name="linknoteref-270020" id="linknoteref-270020">
      20 </a> but his objections against Wolfgang's journey were not by any
      means removed. He wrote to him in a fatherly way, as he informs his
      daughter (March 1, 1787), "that he would make nothing by a journey in
      summer, and would go to England at a wrong time; he would spend about two
      thousand florins, and would certainly come to want, for Storace is sure to
      write the first opera. Wolfgang would lose heart very soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart again abandoned his intention, but not before rumours of it had
      reached the public ear,<a href="#linknote-270021" name="linknoteref-270021"
      id="linknoteref-270021"> 21 </a> rumours which showed the Emperor the
      necessity for giving him a <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p276.png">[276]</a></span> permanent
      post, in order to keep him in Vienna.<a href="#linknote-270022"
      name="linknoteref-270022" id="linknoteref-270022"> 22 </a> Unhappily,
      Mozart's father did not live to see this end to all his anxieties. He died
      on May 28, 1787.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no kapellmeister's place vacant, the Emperor appointed Mozart
      his "private musician," (Kammermusicus) with a salary of eight hundred
      florins. The smallness of the sum was ascribed to the influence of Strack;
      he was, as usual, appealed to for advice, and humoured the Emperor's
      inclination to parsimony. The appointment was made on December 7, 1787; in
      August, 1788, Mozart assures his sister that he is really appointed, and
      that his name appears on the official theatrical list as "kapellmeister in
      the actual service of his imperial majesty." Gluck, who had been appointed
      "private composer" (Kammercompositeur) by Maria Theresa on the 7th of
      October, 1774, with a salary of two thousand florins, died on November 15,
      1787. Mozart naturally took his place; but it does not seem to have
      occurred to the court that a corresponding rise of salary would have been
      no undeserved distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart himself was not dissatisfied with his pay, since none of the
      musicians attached to the imperial household received more; but he was
      justly annoyed, at a later date, when he was suffered to draw his pay
      without having the opportunity given him of producing any important work.
      He looked upon it as an alms doled out to him, while the opportunity of
      distinguishing himself as a composer was denied, and wrote bitterly after
      the customary entry of his income on the official return: "Too much for
      what I do; too little for what I could do."<a href="#linknote-270023"
      name="linknoteref-270023" id="linknoteref-270023"> 23 </a> This was not
      the right way to remind those in authority that a promise of "promotion"
      on the first seasonable opportunity had been held out to him. The cares
      which beset the closing years of the Emperor Joseph are explanation
      sufficient of the decline of his interest in music and the drama and his
      care for the great composer; this, however, the latter failed to perceive.
      It was clear also that he did not know how to turn his <span class="side">OFFERS
      AND HOPES OF PROMOTION.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p277.png">[277]</a></span> opportunities to advantage,
      when, in May, 1789, he refused the offer of Frederick William II. to make
      him kapellmeister in Berlin with three thousand florins salary. With
      unselfish emotion Mozart exclaimed: "How can I desert my good Emperor?"
      The King wished him to reconsider the proposal, and promised to hold to
      his word for an indefinite period if Mozart would consent to come.<a
      href="#linknote-270024" name="linknoteref-270024" id="linknoteref-270024">
      24 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once returned to Vienna, Mozart thought no more of the matter, and only
      after much persuasion from his friends was induced to lay it before the
      Emperor and tender his resignation. In unpleased surprise Joseph asked:
      "What, do you mean to forsake me, Mozart?" Whereupon Mozart answered with
      emotion: "May it please your majesty, I will stay." Upon the question of a
      friend as to whether he had not taken the opportunity of demanding some
      compensation, he exclaimed angrily: "Who the devil would have thought of
      that at such a time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of 1789 he received the commission to write the opera of "Cosi
      fan Tutte," but Joseph II. died (February 20, 1790) before Mozart's
      position had been permanently provided for. After the accession of Leopold
      II. he appears to have made an attempt to obtain the post of second
      kapellmeister under Salieri (old Bono had died in 1788, and Salieri had
      been promoted to his place),<a href="#linknote-270025"
      name="linknoteref-270025" id="linknoteref-270025"> 25 </a> but this also
      was unsuccessful. Convinced that he must now, for the present at least,
      renounce all hope of promotion at court, he applied to the civic
      authorities for the post of assistant to the Kapellmeister Hofmann at the
      Stephans-kirche. The application was granted, with the promise of
      Hofmann's lucrative post in case of his death; but the old man survived
      Mozart, and this hope of an independence fell through with the rest.<a
      href="#linknote-270026" name="linknoteref-270026" id="linknoteref-270026">
      26 </a> Under these circumstances Mozart <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span>

      thrown back for a means of livelihood upon lessons, concerts, and
      composition. We know how much he disliked lesson-giving (Vol. I., p. 411),
      and his dislike was more likely to increase than diminish, and yet he was
      obliged to lay himself out to give lessons. In May, 1790, he wrote to his
      friend Puchberg: "I have two pupils now, and should like to make the
      number up to eight; try to spread it about that I give lessons." Mozart
      was never a fashionable and well-paid music-master in Vienna, such as
      Steffan, Kozeluch, or Righini. This may excite surprise, since he was so
      distinguished as a pianist, but he was wanting in the patience and
      pliability necessary, and perhaps also in steadiness and regularity. When
      he met with talent or enthusiasm, or when he was personally attracted, he
      was fond of giving lessons; as, for instance, to Franziska (afterwards
      Frau von Lagusius), the sister of his friend Gottfried von Jacquin, to
      whom he writes from Prague (January 14, 1787):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I kiss your sister's hand a thousand times, and beg her to practise
      industriously on her new pianoforte&mdash;but the recommendation is
      unnecessary, for I must own that I never had so industrious and zealous a
      pupil as herself&mdash;and I rejoice in the expectation of giving her
      further instruction, according to my poor ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was considered an excellent pianiste, and one of Mozart's best pupils;
      he wrote the trio with clarinet and tenor (498 K.) for her (August 5,
      1786).<a href="#linknote-270027" name="linknoteref-270027"
      id="linknoteref-270027"> 27 </a> He also sent her the grand Sonata for
      four hands in C major (521 K.) as soon as it was finished (May 29, 1787),
      with a message through her brother that "she must set about it at once,
      for it was somewhat difficult." They were mostly ladies to whom he gave
      lessons, for the ladies of high rank in Vienna were cultivated enough to
      be considered as leaders of fashion, <span class="side">LESSONS AND

      students in the genuine sense of the word, such as Frau von Trattnern, to
      whom Mozart addressed elaborate written communications on the execution of
      his clavier compositions, more especially on his Fantasia in C minor,
      composed for her.<a href="#linknote-270029" name="linknoteref-270029"
      id="linknoteref-270029"> 29 </a> For Barbara Ployer he composed (February
      9, 1784) the Concerto in E flat major (449 K.), which he did not consider
      as among his great ones, and the more difficult one in G Major (453 K.);
      and he writes to his father (June 9, 1784):&mdash;

      To-morrow there is to be a concert at Herr Ployer's country-house in
      Dobling; FrÃ¤ulein Babette is to play her new concerto in G, I the quintet
      [with wind instruments, in E flat major, 452 K.], and then both of us the
      grand sonata for two pianos [in D major, composed early in 1784, 448 K.].
      I am to take Paesiello, who has been here since May on his return journey
      from St. Petersburg, in order that he may hear my compositions and my
      pupils.

    <p>
      No doubt the greater number of his pupils either&mdash;like FrÃ¤ulein
      Aumhammer&mdash;cared more for social intercourse with Mozart than for
      actual instruction, or took lessons for a short time only that they might
      be able to speak of the great performer as their teacher. The celebrated
      physician, Jos. Frank, relates that he took twelve lessons from him in
      1790:<a href="#linknote-270030" name="linknoteref-270030"

      I found Mozart a little man with a large head and plump hand, and was
      somewhat coldly received by him. "Now," said he, "play me something." I
      played a fantasia of his own composition. "Not bad," said he, to my great
      astonishment; "but now listen to me play it." It was a miracle! The piano
      became another instrument under his hands. It was strengthened by a second
      piano, which served him as a pedal.<a href="#linknote-270031"
      name="linknoteref-270031" id="linknoteref-270031"> 31 </a> Mozart then
      made some remarks as to the way in which I should perform the fantasia. I
      was fortunate enough to understand him. "Do <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p280.png">[280]</a></span>
      you play any other pieces of my composition?" "Yes," answered I; "your
      variations on the theme 'Unser dummer Pobel meint' (455 K.), and a sonata
      with accompaniments for violin and violoncello." "Good!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will play you that piece; you will profit more by hearing me than by
      playing them yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain that he had the tact and skill to manage even such pupils as
      these. He treated those who had the power and the wish to become true
      artists under his guidance in quite another fashion, and they profited not
      only by his regular instruction, but still more by his encouragement and
      incitement to exertion.

      Johann Nepomuk Hummel came to Vienna in 1785, with his father, who
      afterwards undertook the conductorship of the opera, under Schikaneder; at
      seven years of age the young Hummel already created great expectations by
      his clavier-playing. A pupil of Mozart's, named FreystÃ¤dter, brought
      Hummel to him in 1797; the boy played one of the easier sonatas (with
      which Mozart had no fault to find, except as to the hurried <i>tempo</i>),
      and then one of his newest concertos by heart.<a href="#linknote-270032"
      name="linknoteref-270032" id="linknoteref-270032"> 32 </a> Thereupon
      Mozart decided to undertake Hummel's instruction, but only on condition
      that he resided with them altogether. We are not told how often or with
      what regularity he received lessons; but he heard Mozart play, and had to
      play over to him any clavier music that came into the house. One evening
      Mozart returned late from some entertainment with his wife, and found a
      piece of music which he was curious to hear. Young Hummel, who had been
      awaiting their return, had lain down on a couple of chairs and fallen
      asleep. "Stanzerl," said Mozart, to his wife; "wake Hans, and give him a
      glass of wine." No sooner said than done; and the boy played the new piece
      of music, late at night as it was.<a href="#linknote-270033"
      name="linknoteref-270033" id="linknoteref-270033"> 33 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's musical instruction was sure to be desultory. FreystÃ¤dter relates
      that he generally received Mozart's directions and corrections of his
      musical exercises sitting at a side-table, while a game of bowls was going
      on.<a href="#linknote-270034" name="linknoteref-270034"

      LESSONS IN THEORY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p281.png">[281]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      also tells us that Mozart sometimes persuaded him to join in a game of
      billiards instead of taking a lesson.<a href="#linknote-270035"
      name="linknoteref-270035" id="linknoteref-270035"> 35 </a> The pupils did
      not consider their master guilty of caprice and neglect; but felt
      themselves spurred to activity by their intercourse with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart took young Hummel everywhere with him, made him play, played duets
      with him, and declared that the boy would soon excel himself as a pianist.
      Hummel was greatly attached to Mozart, both then and ever after; he
      remained in his house for two years, until in November, 1788, his father
      set out with him on a professional tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart also gave lessons in the theory of music, sometimes even to ladies;
      we hear of a cousin of the AbbÃ© Stadler as Mozart's pupil in
      thorough-bass. The exercise-book which he used for instruction in
      thorough-bass in 1784 is now in the Imperial library at Vienna.<a
      href="#linknote-270036" name="linknoteref-270036" id="linknoteref-270036">
      36 </a> Mozart wrote down a very characteristic melody, or a bass, or
      both, which the pupil was to arrange in several parts; then Mozart
      corrected the passage with short remarks on the various mistakes,
      alternately Italian or German, sometimes of a comic nature&mdash;for
      instance: "Ho l' onore di dirla, che lei ha fatta la scioc-cagine (da par
      Suo) di far due ottave tra il 2do Violino ed il Basso"; or in German:
      "This E is very forced here; it shows that it has only been put in to
      prevent too rapid a passage from one consonance to another&mdash;just as
      bad poets often do stupid things for the sake of rhyme. You might have
      gone gradually from C to D very prettily by inserting thirds." These
      remarks are purely grammatical; and it is evident that Mozart's teaching
      was of the good old-fashioned kind, which strives first to give the pupil
      a thorough knowledge of the grammar of his art. From exercise-books of
      this kind, of which Zelter saw one in Vienna,<a href="#linknote-270037"
      name="linknoteref-270037" id="linknoteref-270037"> 37 </a> a little <span

      href="pgimages/p282.png">[282]</a></span> handbook of thorough-bass was
      afterwards printed under Mozart's name, and was much in use for some time.<a
      href="#linknote-270038" name="linknoteref-270038" id="linknoteref-270038">
      38 </a> With more advanced pupils he naturally proceeded differently.
      Attwood preserved an exercise-book with compositions, which he had
      submitted to Mozart shortly after his arrival in Vienna. Mozart had
      crossed out whole passages, and rewritten them with the remark, "I should
      have done this so."<a href="#linknote-270039" name="linknoteref-270039"
      id="linknoteref-270039"> 39 </a> When Kelly, the tenor, who made pretty
      little songs which Mozart admired, imagined that he could make himself
      into a serious composer by means of studies in counterpoint, Mozart said
      to him, "If you had studied counterpoint long ago in Naples, you would
      have done well; now that you have to give your mind to your education as a
      singer, you will make nothing of it. Remember that half-knowledge is a
      dangerous thing. You have considerable talent in the invention of
      melodies; a smattering of theory would ruin that, and you can always find
      some musician who can help you when you want it. Melody is the essence of
      music. I should compare one who invents melodies to a noble racehorse, and
      a mere contrapuntist to a hired post hack. So let it alone; and remember
      the old Italian proverb 'Chi sa piÃ¹, meno sa.'"<a href="#linknote-270040"

    </p>
    <p>
      Lesson-giving might fail greatly to increase either Mozart's fame or his
      income, but his success as a virtuoso was brilliant and lasting. His
      father warned him, when he talked of settling in Vienna, of the fickleness
      of the public, but Wolfgang answered cheerfully (June 2, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Viennese certainly love change&mdash;<i>but only at the theatre</i>,
      and my line is too popular not to be supported. This is, in truth, <i>Clavierland!</i>
      and, even supposing they were to tire of me, it would not be for several
      years, and in the meantime I should have made both money and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this expectation he was not disappointed; the applause which greeted
      him on his first appearance was repeated as often as he appeared in
      Vienna.

    </p>
    <p>
      The proper season for concerts, and also for private musical parties, was
      Lent, when the theatres were closed; the concerts were generally given in
      the theatre.<a href="#linknote-270041" name="linknoteref-270041"
      id="linknoteref-270041"> 41 </a> Mozart invariably gave a concert in Lent.
      After the success of the first (1782) he used to make a common undertaking
      every spring with a certain Phil. Jac. Martin. He was a native of
      Regensburg, who had studied with good old Bullinger at the Jesuit College
      in Munich, and supported himself with difficulty: "quite a young man, who
      tries hard to get on in the world by his music, his beautiful handwriting,
      and especially by his clever head and strong intellect" (May 29, 1782).
      Martin had established an amateur musical society, which gave concerts
      every Friday during the winter.<a href="#linknote-270042"
      name="linknoteref-270042" id="linknoteref-270042"> 42 </a> Mozart writes
      to his father (May 8, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You know that there are a number of amateurs here, and very good ones,
      both male and female; hitherto there has been no organisation among them.
      This Martin has now received permission from the Emperor, with expressions
      of the highest approbation, to give twelve concerts in the Augarten and
      four grand evening concerts on the finest open spaces in the city.<a
      href="#linknote-270043" name="linknoteref-270043" id="linknoteref-270043">
      43 </a> The subscription for the whole summer is two ducats. You can well
      imagine that we shall get subscribers enough, all the more for my being

      subscribers, and that the expenses amount to two hundred florins (an
      outside sum), that means three hundred florins profit for each of us.

      The Imperial Augarten replaced the old "Favorite" established by Joseph I.
      in the Leopold Vorstadt of Vienna. It was laid out by Joseph II., and
      opened to the public for their free use in 1775, with the well-known
      inscription over the entrance: "Public place of recreation dedicated to
      all men, by one who esteems them."<a href="#linknote-270044"
      name="linknoteref-270044" id="linknoteref-270044"> 44 </a> The principal
      building was used as an hotel, and the Emperor built for himself a simple
      little house, surrounded by wooden palings, where he sometimes spent
      several days, and amused himself by walking freely among his people. On
      Sunday afternoons in especial, all the fashionable population of Vienna
      strolled there,<a href="#linknote-270045" name="linknoteref-270045"
      id="linknoteref-270045"> 45 </a> so that the speculation promised to be a
      successful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It provided plenty of occupation for its promoters. Mozart writes (May 25,
      1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow is our first entertainment in the Augarten. At half-past eight
      Martin is to call for me in a hackney-coach, and we have six visits to
      make; I must be ready by eleven o'clock to go to Rumbeck; then I dine with
      the Countess Thun; we are to rehearse the music in her garden in the
      evening. There is to be a symphony by Van Swieten, and another by me;
      Mdlle. Berger, an amateur, is to sing; a boy named TÃ¼rk<a
      href="#linknote-270046" name="linknoteref-270046" id="linknoteref-270046">
      46 </a> is to play a violin concerto, and FrÃ¤ulein von Aurnhammer and I
      the duet concerto in E flat (365 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first concert went off well; among the audience were the Archduke
      Maximilian, the Countess Thun, Wallenstein, Baron van Swieten, and many
      other musical connoisseurs, but we hear nothing further of the
      undertaking, which cannot have been so brilliant a success as had been
      hoped.<a href="#linknote-270047" name="linknoteref-270047"
      id="linknoteref-270047"> 47 </a> There was no doubt, however, as to the
      success which Mozart achieved during the Lenten concerts of 1783. He
      contributed greatly towards the success of a concert given by his
      sister-in-law, Aloysia Lange, at the theatre on <span class="side">CONCERT
      FOR ALOYSIA LANGE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p285.png">[285]</a></span>
      March 11. His Parisian symphony for the Concert spirituel (297 K., Vol.
      II., p. 49) was performed on this occasion, after which Madame Lange sang
      the song which he had composed for her in Mannheim: "Non sÃ² d'onde viene"
      (294 K., Vol. I., p. 419), with new variations for the voice. How many
      memories it must have awakened in them both! "Gluck had the box next to
      the Langes," he informed his father (March 12, 1783), "in which was also
      my wife. He could not praise enough either the symphony or the song, and
      he invited us all to dinner next Sunday." In addition Mozart played a
      concerto of his own composition. "The theatre was very full; and I was so
      well received by the public, that I could but feel happy and content.
      After I had gone away the clapping was so persistent that I was obliged to
      return and repeat the rondo. It was a perfect storm of applause." For his
      own concert on March 22 every box was taken, and the theatre "could not
      have been fuller." The programme of this concert, which he copied for his
      father, gives us an idea of what Mozart's concerts were. There were
      performed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The new Hafner symphony, composed the previous summer (385 K., Vol.
      II., p. 210).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Air from "Idomeneo," "Se il padre perdei" (366 K.), sung by Madame
      Lange.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The third subscription concerto, then just published, in C major (415
      K., No. 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Countess Baumgarten's scena (369 K., Vol. II., p. 168), sung by
      Adamberger.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The short Sinfonia-concertante of the last "Final-musik" (320 K., Vol.
      II., p. 87).
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The favourite concerto in D (175, 382 K., Vol. I., p. 324).
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Scena, "Parto, m' affretto," from "Lucio Silla" (135 K., Vol. I., p.
      180), sung by Mdlle. Teyber.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Impromptu fantasia by Mozart, beginning with a short fugue, "because
      the Emperor was there" (Vol. II., p. 173), followed by variations on an
      air from the opera of "Der eingebildete Philosoph" by Paesiello ("Salve
      Tu, Domine"), and when the thunder of applause obliged him to play again,
      he chose the air "Unser dummer PÃ¶bel meint," from Gluck's "Pilgrims of
      Mecca," as a theme for variations.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. A new rondo, composed for Madame Lange, and performed by her (416 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The last movement of the first symphony.

      This programme makes it evident that the demands on a concert-giver were
      far greater then than now, and the public were undoubtedly more patient
      listeners. "What pleased me most," wrote Wolfgang to his father (March 29,
      1783), "was the sight of the Emperor, and how pleased he was, and how he
      applauded me. It is always his custom to send the money for his box to the
      pay-place before he comes to the theatre; otherwise I might certainly have
      expected more (than twenty-five ducats), for his delight was beyond all
      bounds." A short time after Mozart played a concerto at Mdlle. Teyber's
      concert.<a href="#linknote-270048" name="linknoteref-270048"
      id="linknoteref-270048"> 48 </a> Again the rondo was encored, but when he
      sat down to the piano again, he had the desk removed in order to
      improvise. "This little surprise delighted the audience immensely; they
      clapped, and cried 'Bravo, bravissimo!'" The Emperor did not leave this
      concert until Mozart had quite finished playing. So the latter in high
      glee informs his father (April 12,1783). In Lent, 1784,<a
      href="#linknote-270049" name="linknoteref-270049" id="linknoteref-270049">
      49 </a> besides a concert in the theatre, which took place in April,
      Mozart proposed to give six subscription concerts, and he begs his father
      to send him the score of "Idomeneo," because he intended to produce it
      (December 6, 1783).
    </p>

      The pianoforte teacher Richter had established Saturday concerts, which
      were attended by the nobility only upon the understanding that Mozart was
      to play; after playing at three of them he raised subscriptions (six

      "The first concert, on the 17th," Mozart writes (March 20, 1784), "went
      off well; the hall was crammed full, and the new concerto, which I played,
      was very well received; every one is talking about the concert." The
      succeeding performances were equally successful, so that he was able to
      assure his father that they had been of considerable service to him.
      Besides the subscription concerts, he gave two others in the theatre,
      which also went off well. "To-morrow should have been my first concert in
      the theatre," he writes (March 20, 1784), "but Prince Louis Liechtenstein
      has an operatic performance which would have taken half the nobility from
      my audience, besides some of the chief members of the orchestra. So I have
      postponed it, in a printed advertisement, to April 1. He wrote two great
      concertos<a href="#linknote-270053" name="linknoteref-270053"
      id="linknoteref-270053"> 53 </a> and the quintet for piano and wind
      instruments, which was enthusiastically applauded. "I myself," he adds,
      "consider it the best thing I ever wrote in my life. I do wish you could
      have heard it! And how beautifully it was performed! To tell the truth, I
      grew tired of the mere playing towards the end, and it reflects no small
      credit on me that my audience did not in any degree share the fatigue."

      In the following year Leopold Mozart visited his son in Vienna, and was an
      eye-witness of his popularity. He <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p288.png">[288]</a></span> writes
      to his daughter (January 22, 1785): "I have this moment received a line
      from your brother, saying that his concerts begin on February 11, and are
      to continue every Friday." He arranged to be in Vienna for this concert,
      which was given on the Mehlgrube, with a subscription list of over one
      hundred and fifty at three ducats each. He wrote to Marianne at the
      conclusion of the concert (February 11, 1784): "Wolfgang played an
      admirable new concerto, which was in the copyist's hands when we arrived
      yesterday; your brother had not even time to try over the rondo. The
      concerto is in D minor" (466 K., No. 8). The second concert, too, "was
      splendid"; and at a benefit concert in the theatre for which Wolfgang
      wrote the Concerto in C major (467 K., No. 1) he made 559 florins, "which
      we had not expected, as the list for his subscription concerts numbers one
      hundred and fifty persons, and he has often played at other people's
      concerts for nothing," as L. Mozart writes (March 12, 1785). He played at
      Madame Laschi's concert on February 12, 1785, a splendid concerto which he
      had composed for the blind pianiste in Paris, Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Paradies
      (1759-1824); this is probably the Concerto in B major (456 K., No. 11)
      dated September 30, 1784. "When your brother made his exit," writes the
      father, "the Emperor bowed to him, hat in hand, and called: 'Bravo,
      Mozart!' He was very much applauded on his entrance." During the Lent of
      1786 Mozart had, as he wrote to his father (December 28,1785), three
      subscription concerts, with one hundred and twenty subscribers; for these
      he wrote three new concertos. One in E flat major (482 K., No. 6) on
      December 26, 1785, another in A major (488 K., No. 2) on March 2, 1786,
      and the third in C minor on March 24, 1786, the andante of which he was
      obliged to repeat at the concert of April 7, the last given in the
      theatre.<a href="#linknote-270054" name="linknoteref-270054"
      id="linknoteref-270054"> 54 </a> In Advent of the same year, as he informs
      his father (December 8, 1786), he gave four concerts at the Casino, for
      which he composed a new Concerto in C major (503 K., No. 16), dated
      December 4, 1786; in January of the same year he <span class="side">PRIVATE
      CONCERTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p289.png">[289]</a></span>
      journeyed to PragÃ¼e, where he was received with enthusiasm as the composer
      of "Figaro." In obedience to the general desire, he played at a great
      concert in the Opera-House, to a very crowded audience; Mozart was
      recalled three times, and when at last he improvised variations on "Non
      piÃ¹ andrai" there was no end to the applause; a second concert was
      attended with eqally brilliant results. Madame Storace informed L. Mozart,
      who wrote the news to his daughter (March 1, 1787), that Wolfgang had made
      one thousand florins in Prague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if it be granted that the honour and profit of these concerts did not
      equal that which was accorded to celebrated vocalists of the day,<a
      href="#linknote-270055" name="linknoteref-270055" id="linknoteref-270055">
      55 </a> yet it would be unjust to maintain that Mozart was not appreciated
      by the public, and that they failed to express their appreciation in hard
      cash. Any comparison with the unexampled success attained by great
      performers of a later day ought not to leave out of sight that the
      concert-visiting public has enormously increased since that time, when
      this enjoyment was the exclusive privilege of the higher ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing interest for literature and art was then just beginning to
      awaken in the citizen class some desire for participation in theatrical
      performances and concerts; but still the concert public of that time had
      very little resemblance to that which we now expect to find. The
      difference shows itself in the private concerts. During the winter, and
      particularly during Lent, musical performances were the chief means of
      entertainment among the nobility and wealthy citizens. Amateur theatricals
      were also very fashionable, and even operas were often given in private.<a

      56 </a> An opera by Prince Liechtenstein has been mentioned before (Vol.
      II., p. 287); Mozart's "Idomeneo" was given in 1786 at the private theatre
      of Prince Auersperg, where in 1782 an Italian opera had been given in
      honour of the Grand <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span

      Noblemen of high rank often maintained their own musical establishments;
      and though this did not often consist, as in the case of Prince Esterhazy
      or the Prince von Hildburghausen,<a href="#linknote-270060"
      name="linknoteref-270060" id="linknoteref-270060"> 60 </a> of a complete
      orchestra, yet the retinue of most of the nobility (especially in Bohemia)
      were capable of taking part in orchestral music,<a href="#linknote-270061"
      name="linknoteref-270061" id="linknoteref-270061"> 61 </a> or there was at
      least a band of wind instruments to play during meals or in serenades.<a
      href="#linknote-270062" name="linknoteref-270062" id="linknoteref-270062">
      62 </a> But for the private performances of which we have just spoken a
      complete orchestra was always employed,<a href="#linknote-270063"
      name="linknoteref-270063" id="linknoteref-270063"> 63 </a> which was an
      easier matter then than it would be now that orchestras are so much more
      fully appointed. This arrangement was of the greatest importance for the
      musical profession. The frequent concerts gave opportunity for a large
      number of musicians to educate themselves into good orchestral players,
      and the composers found constant employment in every branch of their art.
      Patrons vied with each other in the production of new works by
      distinguished masters, and above all in the acquisition of celebrated
      performers. The expense of musical soirÃ©es was very great, but custom made
      it a point of honour among the aristocracy to patronise the art which then
      surpassed all others in public estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's popularity as a pianist would, as a matter of course, render him
      much in request at these private concerts. As early as the winter of 1782
      he was engaged for all the concerts given by Prince Gallitzin, the Russian
      ambassador, who "placed his carriage at my disposal both going and
      returning, and treated me in the handsomest <span class="side">PRIVATE
      CONCERTS&mdash;NOBLE PATRONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p291.png">[291]</a></span> manner possible' (December
      21,1782). During the following winter he again played regularly for Prince
      Gallitzin, also for Count Johann Esterhazy, Count Zichy, &amp;c. He
      calculates for his father's benefit that, from February 26 till April 3,
      he would have to play five times for Gallitzin, and nine times for
      Esterhazy, to which might be added three of Richter's concerts and five of
      his own, besides chance invitations. "Have I not enough to do?" he asks.
      "I do not think I shall be allowed to get out of practice." When his
      father was in Vienna in 1785, he wrote to his daughter that Wolfgang's
      harpsichord had been to the theatre and to different private houses quite
      twelve times between February 11 and March 12.<a href="#linknote-270064"
      name="linknoteref-270064" id="linknoteref-270064"> 64 </a> What amount of
      fee Mozart received for his performances in private we have no means of
      ascertaining; in general, however, the aristocracy were accustomed to
      reward distinguished artists according to their deserts, and the
      exceptional position of the Viennese nobility enabled the artists to
      accept their liberality without loss of dignity; the more so as it was
      usually founded on sentiments of esteem and consideration. That the
      friendly demeanour of persons of high rank was highly prized by the
      artists themselves, there can be no doubt; nor would there be wanting some
      who sought to merit it by servile adulation. From any tinge of this Mozart
      was absolutely free; not only was he unfettered by the forms of social
      class distinctions, but he moved in society with all the independence of a
      distinguished man, without laying claim to the license usually accorded to
      artists of genius. The etiquette of rank was no bar to his intimacy with
      Prince Karl Lichnowsky; and another of his true friends was Count August
      Hatzfeld, who had carefully cultivated a considerable musical talent, and
      was a first-rate quartet violinist. He became so imbued with the spirit of
      Mozart's quartets, that the latter was said to have declared that he liked
      nobody's execution of them so well as Count <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p292.png">[292]</a></span>
      Hatzfeld's.<a href="#linknote-270065" name="linknoteref-270065"
      id="linknoteref-270065"> 65 </a> The song in "Idomeneo" with obbligato
      violin was composed for him. His noble character won for him universal
      esteem, which was intensified by the calmness with which he met death in
      his thirty-first year (Bonn, 1787). Mozart wrote to his father in a very
      serious letter (April 4, 1787):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject (death and dying) I have already expressed my mind to you
      on the occasion of the melancholy death of my best and dearest friend,
      Count von Hatzfeld. He was thirty-one&mdash;just my age. I do not mourn
      for <i>him</i>, but for myself and for all those who knew him as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart also gave regular musical performances every Sunday morning in his
      own house; he used to invite his friends, and musical amateurs were
      admitted on payment. Kelly relates<a href="#linknote-270066"
      name="linknoteref-270066" id="linknoteref-270066"> 66 </a> that he never
      missed one of these. I find them mentioned elsewhere also, and have heard
      of them from old people who took part in them during the last years of
      Mozart's life. They were always well attended; but whether Mozart's public
      concerts were continued with unabated success after the year 1788, or
      whether the time had come when he was to experience "the fickleness" of
      the Viennese, I have no means of determining with exactitude. He wrote
      three symphonies in June, July, and August of 1788, whence it may be
      concluded that he was giving concerts during that time; and, by the same
      reasoning, the absence of any symphonies or concertos composed during the
      years immediately following would prove that no concerts were then given.
      His pecuniary embarrassments during those years tell the same tale; and
      the cutting off of this important contribution to his income seems to have
      occasioned his journeys to Berlin and Frankfort. Not until January, 1791,
      do we meet with another pianoforte concerto in B flat major (595 K., No.
      15) that was no doubt intended for a Lenten concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The publication of his compositions, which in the present day would have
      been Mozart's chief dependence, was by no means profitable, as matters
      then stood. The music trade <span class="side">PUBLICATION OF
      COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p293.png">[293]</a></span>
      of the day was small and insignificant; indeed, the first impulse was
      given to it by the publication of an edition of all Mozart's works soon
      after his death. During his life, however, compositions were more often
      copied than printed;<a href="#linknote-270067" name="linknoteref-270067"
      id="linknoteref-270067"> 67 </a> and the composer was obliged to keep
      careful watch lest copies should be distributed which were not ordered
      from him, and which in consequence he was never paid for. It need scarcely
      be said that caution such as this was not in Mozart's nature, and that
      copies of his works were frequently made and sold without his knowledge.
      Different musical firms (Joh. Traeg, Lausch, Torricella, &amp;c.)
      advertised copies of his compositions for sale under his very eyes; nor
      was this conduct, however undesirable, thought unworthy of a respectable
      tradesmen. He was careful only of his concertos; too much depended on his
      keeping possession of them, and not allowing any one to play them who
      chose. His three first concertos, indeed, he thought it advisable to
      publish himself by a subscription of six ducats (December 23, 1782). He
      offered them afterwards to the "highly respectable public" for four
      ducats, "beautifully copied and revised by himself."<a
      href="#linknote-270068" name="linknoteref-270068" id="linknoteref-270068">
      68 </a> Even this his father thought too dear; but Mozart thought that the
      concertos were worth the money, and could not be copied for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When sending his father those composed in the following year, he wrote
      (May 24, 1784): "I can wait patiently until you send them back, so long as
      they do not fall into any one else's hands; I might have had twenty-four
      ducats for one of them to-day; but I think it will be to my advantage to
      keep them a couple of years by me, and then to have them printed." He used
      to take only the orchestral parts with him on his journeys, and to play
      himself from a clavier part of most extraordinary appearance, according to
      Rochlitz.<a href="#linknote-270069" name="linknoteref-270069"
      id="linknoteref-270069"> 69 </a> It consisted of only the figured bass and

      href="pgimages/p294.png">[294]</a></span> motifs, with hints for the
      passages, runs, &amp;c.; he depended on his memory, which never by any
      chance failed him. In 1788 he advertised copies of three quintets for four
      ducats.<a href="#linknote-270070" name="linknoteref-270070"
      id="linknoteref-270070"> 70 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As far, then, as concertos and symphonies were concerned, the composer
      made his principal profit by his own performance of them; but he was also
      called upon to write different things for other people. Mozart wrote many
      compositions for his pupils, an extraordinary number for his friends and
      acquaintance, and not a few to order on particular occasions. Among the
      latter class are the quartets written for Frederick William II., in 1789
      and 1790 (575, 589, 590, K.), for which he was doubtless well paid; it was
      said that he received for the first a valuable gold snuff-box and a
      hundred friedrichs-d'or.<a href="#linknote-270071"
      name="linknoteref-270071" id="linknoteref-270071"> 71 </a> It is well
      known that one hundred ducats were paid in advance for the Requiem, and
      something may have come in for the adaptation of Handel's oratorios,
      ordered by Van Swieten in 1788 and 1789, as well as for here and there a
      commission or dedication. But a closer examination of the long list of
      Mozart's compositions of this class makes it probable that they were not
      for the most part profitable to him. A characteristic anecdote is related
      of him by his widow, which bears out this supposition.<a
      href="#linknote-270072" name="linknoteref-270072" id="linknoteref-270072">
      72 </a> At one of Mozart's Sunday matinÃ©es there was present a Polish
      Count, who was very much delighted with the new (composed March 30, 1784)
      pianoforte quintet with wind instruments. He commissioned Mozart to write
      a trio with obbligato flute, which the latter promised to do. As soon as
      he arrived at home, the Count sent Mozart a hundred half-louis with a very
      polite note, repeating his thanks for the pleasure the music had given
      him. The terms of the note left Mozart no doubt that the money was a
      generous gift, and he returned the politest acknowledgment, at the same
      time sending the Count, contrary to his custom, the original score of the
      quintet he had so much admired. A year after the Count came again to
      Mozart and inquired after the trio. Mozart excused himself by saying he
      had not yet found himself in the humour to <span class="side">PUBLICATION
      OF COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p295.png">[295]</a></span>
      write anything worthy of the Count's acceptance. "Then, no doubt,"
      answered the Count, "you will find yourself still less in the humour to
      return me the hundred half-louis which I paid you for it." Mozart returned
      the money, but the Count kept the score of the quintet, which was soon
      after printed in Vienna without Mozart's permission. Against such persons
      and such behaviour Mozart had no weapons but a shrug of the shoulders, and
      a&mdash;"The rascal!" It may well be supposed that others besides this
      Polish Count took advantage of such easy-going good-nature. But the
      publishers must not be credited with more than their share of blame.<a
      href="#linknote-270073" name="linknoteref-270073" id="linknoteref-270073">
      73 </a> Variations and similar trifles were doubtless often printed
      without the composer's consent, and brought in considerable profits in
      which he had no share. But the more important of his works which appeared
      during his lifetime were either printed by subscription or trusted for
      publication to Torricella, Artaria, and Hoffmeister. I have only in one
      case been able to discover the amount paid to him; he wrote to his father,
      who communicated it to his daughter (January 22, 1785) that he had sold
      his quartets dedicated to Jos. Haydn to Artaria for one hundred ducats.
      This was a considerable sum for those days, and the reception given to the
      quartets on their appearance might well cause the publisher to fear he had
      paid too dear for them. It is said that the two beautiful pianoforte
      quartets in G minor (478 K., composed in July, 1785) and in E flat major
      (493 K., composed in June, 1786), were only the commencement of a series
      bespoken by Hoffmeister; but the public finding them too difficult, and
      refraining from buying them, he allowed Mozart to retain the money he had
      paid in advance, and gave up the continuation.<a href="#linknote-270074"
      name="linknoteref-270074" id="linknoteref-270074"> 74 </a> The popularity
      gained by Mozart's greater works must always have been of gradual growth,
      since they were considered in every respect too difficult, and it is quite
      credible that Hoffmeister said, as was reported of him:<a
      href="#linknote-270075" name="linknoteref-270075" id="linknoteref-270075">
      75 </a> "Write more popularly, or else I can neither print nor pay for
      anything more of yours!" <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p296.png">[296]</a></span> Nor is it
      less credible that Mozart should have answered: "Then I will write nothing
      more, and go hungry, or may the devil take me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A note written to Hoffmeister on November 20, 1785, is indeed in quite
      another tone:<a href="#linknote-270076" name="linknoteref-270076"

      Dear Hoffmeister,&mdash;I have recourse to you, and beg you to assist me
      with a little money, of which I am much in want at present. I earnestly
      entreat you to send me what I require as soon as possible. Pardon my
      troubling you so much, but you know me, and are aware how much I have your
      affairs at heart, so that I am convinced that you will not be offended at
      my importunities, but will be as ready to show yourself my friend as I am
      yours.

      A very enterprising publisher, Commerzienrath Hummel, of Berlin,
      maintained that, though not musical, he could tell by the look of a
      composition whether it would suit him. He had a poor opinion of Mozart,
      and used to boast of having sent him back various works.<a

      Rochlitz relates, as an instance of Mozart's ill-treatment at the hands of
      theatrical managers,<a href="#linknote-270078" name="linknoteref-270078"
      id="linknoteref-270078"> 78 </a> that Schikaneder paid nothing for the
      "ZauberflÃ¶te," and even, contrary to the agreement, sold the score without
      his knowledge. Seyfried,<a href="#linknote-270079"
      name="linknoteref-270079" id="linknoteref-270079"> 79 </a> on the other
      hand, maintains that Schikaneder paid Mozart a hundred ducats, and
      resigned the net profits of the sale of the score to his widow. Be this as
      it may, Schikaneder's treatment of Mozart must not be considered
      illustrative of that which he usually received from his managers. A
      hundred ducats was then the usual payment in Vienna for an opera. This sum
      Mozart received for the "EntfÃ¼hrung," for "Figaro," and no doubt also for
      "Cosi fan Tutte." For "Don Giovanni" he had 225 florins. To this were
      usually added the proceeds of a benefit performance (and another for the
      poet), which of course depended on the popularity of the composer with the
      public. Mozart does not mention the benefit performance of the <span
      class="side">PROFITS ON OPERAS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p297.png">[297]</a></span> "EntfÃ¼hrung"; but both in this
      case and that of "Figaro" it must have had considerable results.<a
      href="#linknote-270080" name="linknoteref-270080" id="linknoteref-270080">
      80 </a> Bondini paid a hundred ducats for "Don Giovanni." The Bohemian
      States, who ordered the "Clemenza di Tito" for their coronation festival,
      can scarcely have offered him less remuneration; even the manager
      Guardasoni, who was famous for his parsimony, "almost agreed" in the year
      1785 to give Mozart "two hundred ducats for an opera and fifty ducats
      travelling expenses," as he informs his wife&mdash;an agreement, however,
      which was never carried out.<a href="#linknote-270081"
      name="linknoteref-270081" id="linknoteref-270081"> 81 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect, therefore, Mozart was not behind contemporary composers.
      With regard to performances on foreign stages, we have no definite
      information as to whether his permission was asked or paid for,<a
      href="#linknote-270082" name="linknoteref-270082" id="linknoteref-270082">
      82 </a> but we may gather something from the ordinary usages of the time.
      It was the traditional custom in Italy that whoever ordered the opera
      should pay for it; what became of the score afterwards was generally left
      to chance. The impresario remained in possession of it, and usually
      allowed the copyist to make what profit he could out of the sale of it
      (Vol. I., p. 131); but the composer also kept the score, and seems to have
      distributed it wherever he thought he might gain honour or profit by it.
      In Germany the case was altered, since there the composer had generally to
      do with a court theatre. In Mannheim and Munich he retained undivided
      possession of the score (Vol. II., p. 141).<a href="#linknote-270083"
      name="linknoteref-270083" id="linknoteref-270083"> 83 </a> Mozart rejoiced
      that Baron Riedesel had asked him for the "EntfÃ¼hrung" and not the copyist
      (Vol. II., p. 213). As a matter of course foreign theatres took the
      easiest course open to them to obtain possession of the score. When they
      applied to the composer it was only because they saw no other way of
      getting it, or for some special reason. Any question of <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p298.png">[298]</a></span>
      the composer's rights or the theatrical manager's obligations seems never
      to have occurred to either party. A careful hold of the score and watchful
      supervision of the copyist were the only means of protection. These did
      not go far, nor was Mozart the man to make use of them. When, therefore,
      his operas appeared on foreign boards without any compensation to himself,
      he only shared the fate of most of his contemporaries, nor does he seem to
      have complained of it. He is glad to write to his father (December 6,
      1783) that his "EntfÃ¼hrung" had been well and successfully performed in
      Prague and Leipzig; and he rejoiced again when "Figaro" was given in
      Prague and "Don Giovanni" in Vienna; but there is no mention of payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we summarise these financial remarks, we shall arrive at the conclusion
      that in view of the importance of his works, and the profits afterwards
      made on them both by the theatres and the publishers, Mozart was very
      inadequately paid; but this standard cannot be unreservedly applied to
      them. The conditions and fluctuations of profit to which even artists are
      subject are ruled by the prevalent type of living among citizens and the
      higher classes; the close-fisted organisation of a community of merchants
      and traders cares little for the comet-like course of an artistic genius,
      and is only too likely to give it an altogether wrong direction or to ruin
      it at the outset. From a pecuniary point of view we must acknowledge that
      Mozart was on the whole as well treated as the majority of his
      fellow-artists; that both as a composer and a performer he was sometimes
      no worse, sometimes better, paid than others; that he had no lack of
      opportunities for earning money, and that in point of fact he had a very
      good income. If Mozart had possessed the same capacity for business as his
      father or Joseph Haydn, he would no doubt have reaped far greater
      advantages from his position in Vienna; but even on what he actually
      earned he might have lived in ease and plenty. Without ourselves going
      into calculations on the subject, we have a trustworthy witness for it in
      Leopold Mozart. During his visit to Vienna, in 1785, he had a watchful eye
      on the earnings and expenditure of his son, and wrote to his <span
      class="side">PECUNIARY EMBARRASSMENT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p299.png">[299]</a></span> daughter (March 19, 1785): "I
      believe that, <i>if he has no debts to pay</i>, my son can now lay by two
      thousand florins; the money is certainly there, and the household
      expenses, so far as eating and drinking are concerned, could not be more
      economical." How far removed was Mozart from such providence! From the
      time of his marriage we find him in constantly recurring money
      difficulties; a long list of melancholy documents lets us into the
      vexations, cares, and humiliations which were the inevitable consequences
      of his improvidence. Scarcely six months after their marriage the wedded
      couple were obliged to apply to the Baroness von WaldstÃ¤dten in the
      following note, in order to avert a threatened action-at-law by one of
      their creditors:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Most honoured Baroness,&mdash;I find myself in a fine position, truly! We
      agreed with Herr von Tranner lately that we should have a fortnight's
      grace. As this is customary with every merchant, unless he be the most
      disobliging fellow in the world, I thought nothing more of it, and hoped,
      if I could not pay the amount myself, at least to be able to borrow it.
      Now Herr von Tranner sends me word that he positively refuses to wait, and
      if I do not pay him between to-day and to-morrow he will bring an action
      against me! I cannot pay him even the half of it. If I had had any idea
      that the subscriptions for my concert would come in so slowly, I would
      have fixed the payment for a later date. I pray your ladyship, for
      Heaven's sake, to help me to preserve my honour and my good name! My poor
      little wife is feeling poorly, and I cannot leave her, or else I would
      come myself and beg this favour of you by word of mouth..We kiss your
      ladyship's hand a thousand times, and beg to remain your ladyship's

    <p>
      In July of the same year, when he was setting out for Salzburg, and
      actually in the act of entering his carriage, he was stopped by an
      importunate creditor for the paltry claim of thirty florins, which,
      nevertheless, he found it difficult to satisfy.<a href="#linknote-270084"
      name="linknoteref-270084" id="linknoteref-270084"> 84 </a> And not long
      after his return to Vienna he was disagreeably surprised by a demand for
      twelve louis-d'or, which he had borrowed at Strasburg in 1778. He was
      obliged to write to his father:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      You will remember that when you came to Munich, where I was writing the
      great opera, you reproached me for having borrowed twelve louis-d'ors from
      Herr Scherz, at Strasburg, with the words, "Your want of confidence in me
      disappoints me&mdash;but enough; I suppose I shall have the honour of
      paying the twelve louis-d'or." I travelled to Vienna, you to Salzburg.
      What could I suppose from your words but that I need think no more of the
      debt&mdash;or at least, that you would write to me if you did not pay it,
      or speak about it when I saw you in Salzburg? I ask nothing further of
      you, my dear father, than that you will be my security for a month. Had he
      demanded payment during the first year I could have done it at once and
      with pleasure; and I will pay him as it is, only I am not in a position to
      do so at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very same year that his father boasts of his finances, we find him
      in a difficulty which necessitated his applying to his publisher,
      Hoffmeister, who put him off with a couple of ducats. But the saddest
      insight into the embarrassed and humiliating position in which Mozart
      found himself after the year 1788 is afforded by his letters to his
      friend, Michael Puchberg, a wealthy merchant,<a href="#linknote-270085"
      name="linknoteref-270085" id="linknoteref-270085"> 85 </a> musical
      himself, and with two daughters, one of whom distinguished herself as a
      clavier-player. He was a Freemason, and it seems to have been through the
      lodge that an intimacy was founded close enough to warrant Mozart's
      constant application to him for assistance. His wish to borrow a sum
      sufficiently large to be of permanent benefit to him, either from Puchberg
      himself or by his instrumentality, was not granted. So that when his rent
      became due, or his wife's doctor's bill, or a stay in the country had to
      be provided for, he was constantly obliged to claim assistance from his
      friend. Whenever it was possible Mozart strove to meet his household
      embarrassments in a joking mood. In the winter of 1790 Joseph Deiner, the
      landlord of the "Silver Serpent," who was of use to Mozart in many of his
      household affairs, called upon him one day and found him in his workroom
      dancing about with his wife. On Deiner's asking him if he was giving his
      wife dancing lessons, Mozart answered, laughing, "We are <span class="side">PECUNIARY
      EMBARRASSMENT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p301.png">[301]</a></span>
      warming ourselves, because we are very cold, and have no money to buy
      fuel." Thereupon Deiner ran home and brought them some wood, which Mozart
      accepted and promised to pay him for as soon as he made any money.<a
      href="#linknote-270086" name="linknoteref-270086" id="linknoteref-270086">
      86 </a> But dancing will not satisfy every need, and the faithful Puchberg
      was never weary of assisting Mozart. He sent him larger or smaller sums,
      which Mozart was never in a position to repay, so that after his death his
      liabilities amounted to one thousand florins. Puchberg, who was of great
      service to Mozart's widow in the ordering of her affairs, postponed his
      claims for several years, so as to give her the opportunity of paying him
      by degrees, as her circumstances improved.<a href="#linknote-270087"
      name="linknoteref-270087" id="linknoteref-270087"> 87 </a> Mozart had
      recourse to other friends besides Puchberg; in April, 1789, he borrowed
      one hundred florins from an aspirant to Freemasonry, named Hofdemel, as is
      testified by the existing letter and note of hand.<a
      href="#linknote-270088" name="linknoteref-270088" id="linknoteref-270088">
      88 </a> It was not likely that assistance of this kind would materially
      improve Mozart's position. In 1790, when he undertook the journey to
      Frankfort, in the result of which he had placed great hopes, he was
      obliged to raise his travelling expenses by pawning plate and ornaments;<a
      href="#linknote-270089" name="linknoteref-270089" id="linknoteref-270089">
      89 </a> and the financial transaction of which he speaks in his letters to
      his wife, whereby somebody was to hand him over one thousand florins on
      Hoffmeister's endorsement, shows clearly enough that he had fallen into
      the hands of usurers, from whom he had striven in vain to free himself by
      Puchberg's intervention. These facts prove only too clearly that from the
      time of his marriage Mozart became gradually entangled in a net of
      embarrassments, without any hope of permanent extrication. His letters
      show how deeply he felt the cares and humiliations of his position. The
      circumstances of so public a character could not remain long concealed in
      Vienna, even had he been less injudiciously open than he was; after his
      death ill-natured gossip exaggerated his debts to a sum of thirty thousand
      florins, and the rumour reached the ear of the Emperor Leopold. The widow,
      informed of this by a <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p302.png">[302]</a></span> friend of
      high rank, explained the calumny to the Emperor, and assured him that
      three thousand florins would cover all Mozart's debts. The Emperor gave
      her generous assistance as soon as the facts and extenuating circumstances
      had been made known to him,<a href="#linknote-270090"
      name="linknoteref-270090" id="linknoteref-270090"> 90 </a> but he refused
      a pension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same charitable dispositions which settled the amount of Mozart's
      debts were also busy in accounting for the fact of their existence. How
      could they have been contracted but by dissipation, irregular living, and
      extravagance?<a href="#linknote-270091" name="linknoteref-270091"
      id="linknoteref-270091"> 91 </a> Against such accusations we must listen
      to Mozart himself, who would hardly have had the face to appeal to his
      manner of life and well-known habits in applying for help to his intimate
      friend Puchberg, if he had been conscious of such improprieties as those
      with which he was charged. Leopold Mozart's testimony is unimpeachable as
      to the economy of the housekeeping in the matter of eating and drinking,
      and it was confirmed by Sophie Haibl. It may be thought that the father
      purposely limits his praise of Wolfgang's economy to matters of eating and
      drinking, and this is no doubt quite possible. Mozart was very neat and
      particular in his dress, and fond of lace and watch-chains.<a
      href="#linknote-270092" name="linknoteref-270092" id="linknoteref-270092">
      92 </a> Clementi <span class="side">EXTRAVAGANCE AND LOVE OF PLEASURE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p303.png">[303]</a></span> took
      him for a valet-de-chambre on account of his elegant appearance, and his
      handsome attire is referred to on various occasions. His father writes
      mockingly to his daughter from Vienna (April 16, 1785) that Wolfgang and
      Madame Lange had intended going with him to Munich, but nothing was likely
      to come of it, "although each of them have had six pairs of shoes made,
      which are all standing there now." It may well be then that Mozart was not
      over-economical in his dress; at the same time there is no reason to
      accuse him of extravagant foppery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excess of which Mozart was mainly accused, however, was not of this
      kind at all, but lay more in the direction of sensual indulgence. He had
      always been extremely fond of cheerful society and the manifold
      distractions it brought with it; nay, it was quite a necessity to him, as
      a refreshment after long-sustained mental efforts. Mozart gave no parties
      at home, but his wife used to organise little musical performances on
      family festivals or to amuse her husband; few friends were present on such
      occasions, and Haydn's music was generally preferred by Mozart himself.<a
      href="#linknote-270093" name="linknoteref-270093" id="linknoteref-270093">
      93 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There can have been no lack of opportunities for intercourse with his
      fellow-artists and with the numerous accomplished and wealthy amateurs
      then in Vienna, and we can well imagine that Mozart's social impulses
      found constant and lively exercise. Music was the principal object of
      meeting, and Mozart brought his tribute to the entertainment in the form
      of improvisation, both grave and gay; he was a lively and cheerful
      companion, too, in other respects, always ready for a joke, and fond of
      exercising his gift for improvising comic doggerel verses.<a
      href="#linknote-270094" name="linknoteref-270094" id="linknoteref-270094">
      94 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all amusements, Mozart was fondest of dancing, and <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p304.png">[304]</a></span>
      found ample opportunity for indulging his passion in Vienna, where dancing
      was at that time an absolute rage.<a href="#linknote-270095"
      name="linknoteref-270095" id="linknoteref-270095"> 95 </a> His wife
      confided to Kelly, who saw Mozart dance on the occasion of their first
      meeting, that her husband was an enthusiastic dancer, and thought more of
      his performances in that line than in music; he was said to dance the
      minuet very beautifully.<a href="#linknote-270096"
      name="linknoteref-270096" id="linknoteref-270096"> 96 </a> His letters
      have many indications of this partiality, and he gives his father a merry
      and complacent account of a ball at his own house (January 22, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Last week I gave a ball in my own house; but of course the gentlemen paid
      two florins each. We began at six o'clock in the evening and left off at
      seven. What! only one hour? No, no; seven o'clock in the morning! You will
      scarcely believe that I could find room for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lately moved, and had taken apartments with Herr von Wezlar, a rich
      Jew:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There I have a room a thousand paces long, and a bedroom, then an
      anteroom, and then a fine large kitchen; there are two fine large rooms
      next to ours, which stand empty at present, and these I made use of for
      the ball. Baron Wezlar and his wife were there, so were the Baroness
      WaldstÃ¤dten, Herr von Edelbach, Gilowsky the boaster, young Stephanie,
      Adamberger and his wife, the Langes, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more exciting entertainments were the masked balls; and we have
      already seen (Vol. I.,p. 337) that Mozart possessed both inclination and
      talent for disporting himself in assumed characters. He writes from Vienna
      (January 22, 1788), begging his father to send him his harlequin's dress,
      because he would like to go on the Redoute as harlequin: "but so that
      nobody should know it; there are so many here (chiefly great asses) who go
      on the Redoute." Several good friends associated themselves into a
      "compagnie-masque," and performed a pantomime on Whit Monday, which filled
      up the half-hour before dancing began. Mozart was Harlequin, Madame Lange
      Columbine, Lange played Pierrot, an old dancing-master named Merk, who
      "drilled" the company, took Pantaloon, and the painter Grassi the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plot and music were by Mozart, the doggerel verses <span class="side">AMUSEMENTS&mdash;ILLNESS</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p305.png">[305]</a></span> with
      which the pantomime was introduced by the actor MÃ¼ller; it might have been
      better, Mozart thought, but he was satisfied with the acting: "I assure
      you we played very well," he informs his father (March 12,1783). Of the
      music for this pantomime thirteen numbers for stringed instruments in
      parts are preserved, the first violin written by Mozart (446 K.) It is, as
      may be imagined, very unpretending, as are also the briefly indicated
      situations; for instance: "Columbine is sad&mdash;Pantaloon makes love to
      her&mdash;she is angry&mdash;he is gay&mdash;she angry&mdash;he angry
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another passion of Mozart's was billiard-playing; Kelly relates that he
      often played with Mozart, but never won a game.<a href="#linknote-270097"
      name="linknoteref-270097" id="linknoteref-270097"> 97 </a> He had a
      billiard-table in his own house, and played with his wife in case of need,<a

      98 </a> or even quite alone. This was certainly a luxury, though far from
      an unusual one in Vienna at that time, and it was occasioned not solely
      from love of the game,<a href="#linknote-270099" name="linknoteref-270099"
      id="linknoteref-270099"> 99 </a> but, as Holmes rightly remarks, from the
      care of the physicians for Mozart's health.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1783 he was seized with cholera, which was raging as an
      epidemic,<a href="#linknote-2700100" name="linknoteref-2700100"
      id="linknoteref-2700100"> 100 </a> and in the following summer he was
      again seriously ill, as Leopold Mozart informs his daughter (September 14,
      1784):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My son has been very ill in Vienna. He was very much overheated at
      Paesiello's new opera, "Il Reteodoro," and was obliged to go into the open
      air to look for the servant who had charge of his overcoat, because orders
      had been given that no servants should be admitted to the theatre by the
      ordinary entrance. This brought on rheumatic fever, which without careful
      attention might have turned to typhus. Wolfgang writes: "I have had raging
      colic every day for a fortnight at the same hour, accompanied by violent
      vomiting. My doctor, Herr Sigmund Barisani, was in the habit of visiting
      me almost daily even before this illness; he is very clever, and you will
      see that he will soon make himself a name."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barisani was the son of the Archbishop's physician at Salzburg, an
      intimate friend of the Mozart family. He was <span class="side">MARRIED
      LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p306.png">[306]</a></span>
      distinguished in his profession, becoming later chief physician at the
      general hospital, and a warm friend and admirer of Mozart. A charming
      memorial of their friendship is preserved at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, in
      the form of some affectionate verses addressed to Mozart by Barisani,
      bearing date April 14, 1787. Underneath Mozart has written the following
      lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, September 3 of this same year, I was so unfortunate as to lose by
      death this noble-natured man, my dearest, best friend, and the saviour of
      my life. It is well with him! but with me&mdash;us&mdash;and all who knew
      him&mdash;it can never be well again, until we are so happy as to meet him
      in another world <i>never to part again.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Barisani, seeing the impossibility of altogether weaning Mozart from the
      habit of writing far into the night, and very often as he lay in bed in
      the morning, endeavoured to avert the hurtful consequences in another way.
      He recommended him not to sit so long at the clavier, but at all events to
      compose standing, and to take as much bodily exercise as he could.<a
      href="#linknote-2700101" name="linknoteref-2700101"
      id="linknoteref-2700101"> 101 </a> His love of billiard-playing gave the
      doctor a welcome pretext for turning this motive into a regular one;
      Mozart was equally fond of bowls, and he was the more ready to follow the
      doctor's directions with regard to both games since they did not interfere
      with his intellectual activity. It happened one day in Prague that Mozart,
      while he was playing billiards, hummed an air, and looked from time to
      time into a book which he had with him; it appeared afterwards that he had
      been occupied with the first quintet of the "Zauberflote."<a
      href="#linknote-2700102" name="linknoteref-2700102"
      id="linknoteref-2700102"> 102 </a> When he was writing down the score of
      "Don Giovanni" in Duschek's garden, he took part at the same time in a
      game of quoits; he stood up when his turn came round, and sat down again
      to his writing after he had thrown.<a href="#linknote-2700103"
      name="linknoteref-2700103" id="linknoteref-2700103"> 103 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of Mozart's inclination for strong drink, so often talked of?
      There can be no doubt that he was very fond of punch; Kelly speaks of it,<a
      href="#linknote-2700104" name="linknoteref-2700104"
      id="linknoteref-2700104"> 104 </a> and Sophie Haibl does not <span
      class="side">MOZART'S LOVE OF WINE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p307.png">[307]</a></span> disguise that her brother-in-law
      loved a "punscherl," but she also asserts that he had never taken it
      immoderately, and that she had never seen him intoxicated.<a
      href="#linknote-2700105" name="linknoteref-2700105"
      id="linknoteref-2700105"> 105 </a> That he was capable of wild excess is
      contradicted by his whole nature and by his conduct through life; but
      these make it probable that he did not disdain the <i>poculum hilaritatis</i>
      in cheerful society, and that he gave vent to his spirits in a manner more
      unrestrained than it should have been.<a href="#linknote-2700106"
      name="linknoteref-2700106" id="linknoteref-2700106"> 106 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mozart also fortified himself with a glass of wine or punch when he
      was in the throes of composition. In one of his apartments his immediate
      neighbour was Joh. Mart. Loibl, who was musical and a Freemason,
      consequently intimate with Mozart; he had a well-filled wine-cellar, of
      the contents of which he was never sparing in entertaining his friends.
      The partition wall between the houses was so thin, that Mozart had only to
      knock when he wished to attract Loibl's attention; whenever Loibl heard
      the clavier going and taps at his wall between the pauses, he used to send
      his servant into the cellar, and say to his family, "Mozart is composing
      again; I must send him some wine."<a href="#linknote-2700107"
      name="linknoteref-2700107" id="linknoteref-2700107"> 107 </a> His wife
      made him punch, too, when he was writing the overture to "Don Giovanni"
      the night before its performance. Whoever casts a glance over Mozart's
      scores will see that they could not have been written in the excitement
      caused by wine, so neat and orderly are they even to the smallest details,
      and in spite of the most rapid execution; and those who are in a position
      to examine any one of his compositions will not need to be told that no
      intellect overstrained and excited by artificial means could possibly have
      produced such perfect clearness and beauty. Whether Mozart was right in
      providing a bodily stimulus in the form of strong drink during a
      continuous intellectual strain may well be doubted; experience and
      opinions differ widely on this point. Goethe advised that there should be
      no forcing an <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p308.png">[308]</a></span> unproductive mood into activity
      by external means of any kind; but he answered Eckermann's remark that a
      couple of glasses of wine were often of great service in clearing the
      mental vision, and bringing difficult subjects to a solution, as follows:
      "You know my Divan so well that you will remember that I said myself&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Wenn man getrunken hat,
     Weiss man das Rechte,
</pre>
    <p>
      and that I entirely agree with you. There exist in wine inspiring forces
      of a very important kind; but all depends upon circumstances and times and
      places, and what is useful to one does harm to another."<a
      href="#linknote-2700108" name="linknoteref-2700108"
      id="linknoteref-2700108"> 108 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now gather into one the separate traits which we have been
      constrained to discuss, owing to the wide dissemination of those injurious
      reports against which Niemetschek has already rightly protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have before us the picture of a cheerful, pleasure-loving man, capable
      of such exertions of productive power and such intellectual industry as
      have seldom been surpassed in the history of art, and seeking his
      necessary recreation in social intercourse and the pleasures of the senses
      to a degree which was equalled by the majority of his contemporaries in
      Vienna without exciting any attention at all. He was not by any means a
      thoughtless, dissipated spendthrift. But a spendthrift he was, if the word
      be taken to signify one who fails to control his wants and luxuries, so
      that they may be in proportion to the actual state of his finances. His
      most dangerous qualities were a good-natured soft-heartedness, and a
      spontaneous generosity. He gave, as it were, involuntarily, from inner
      necessity. Rochlitz relates that he not only gave free admissions to the
      chorus-singers at Leipzig, to which they had no claim, but that he
      privately pressed a considerable present into the hands of one of the bass
      singers who had specially pleased him. When a poor old piano-tuner,
      stammering with embarrassment, begged for a thaler, Mozart pressed a
      couple of ducats into his hand and <span class="side">MOZART'S THOUGHTLESS
      LIBERALITY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p309.png">[309]</a></span>
      hurried from the room.<a href="#linknote-2700109"
      name="linknoteref-2700109" id="linknoteref-2700109"> 109 </a> When he was
      in a position to give help, he could not see any one in want without
      offering relief, even though it entailed future difficulties on himself
      and his family; repeated experiences made him no more prudent in this
      respect. That he was often imposed upon there can be no doubt. Whoever
      came to him at meal-time was his guest, all the more welcome if he could
      make or understand a joke, and Mozart was happy if only his guests enjoyed
      their fare. Among them were doubtless, as Sophie Haibl relates, "false
      friends, secret blood-suckers, and worthless people, who served only to
      amuse him at table, and intercourse with whom injured his reputation."<a
      href="#linknote-2700110" name="linknoteref-2700110"
      id="linknoteref-2700110"> 110 </a> One of the worst of this set was Albert
      Stadler, who may serve as an example of the way in which Mozart was
      sometimes treated. He was an excellent clarinet-player, and a Freemason;
      he was full of jokes and nonsense, and contrived so to ingratiate himself
      with Mozart that the latter constantly invited him to his house and
      composed many things for him. Once, having learnt that Mozart had just
      received fifty ducats, he represented himself as undone if he could not
      succeed in borrowing that very sum. Mozart, who wanted the money himself,
      gave him two valuable repeater watches to put in pawn upon condition that
      he should bring him the tickets and redeem them in due time; as he did not
      do this, Mozart gave him fifty ducats, besides the interest, in order not
      to lose his watches. Stadler kept the money, and allowed the watches to
      remain at the pawnbroker's. Nowise profiting by this experience, Mozart,
      on his return from Frankfort, in
    </p>
    <p>
      1790, commissioned Stadler to redeem from pawn a portion of the silver
      plate which had been pledged for the expenses of the journey and to renew
      the agreement for the remainder. In spite of a very strong suspicion that
      Stadler had purloined this pawn-ticket from Mozart's open cashbox, the
      latter was not deterred from assisting him in the following year towards a
      professional tour, both with money and recommendations, in Prague, and
      from presenting him with <span class="side">MARRIED LIFE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p310.png">[310]</a></span> a concerto
      (622 K.), composed only a few months before Mozart's death.<a
      href="#linknote-2700111" name="linknoteref-2700111"
      id="linknoteref-2700111"> 111 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt all this shows culpable weakness on Mozart's part&mdash;weakness
      incompatible with his duty to himself and his family. His household
      burdens were increased by many misfortunes, especially by the repeated and
      long-continued illnesses of his wife, necessitating an expensive sojourn
      in Baden for many successive summers. Her delicacy doubtless prevented
      such personal supervision of the household as was essential to its
      economical management. She failed also to acquire such an intellectual
      influence over her husband as to strengthen his capacity for the proper
      conduct of his affairs, and she had not strength of mind or energy to take
      the management of the household entirely into her own hands. She felt the
      discomfort keenly, saw the causes of it, but could not strive against them
      for any length of time. Without wishing to reproach her, we may say at
      least that had Constanze been as good a housekeeper as Mozart was a
      composer, things would have gone well with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that Mozart was blind to the advantages of good
      household management or wanting in the will to effect it; from time to
      time he made earnest endeavours after economic reform. In February, 1784,
      he began an exact catalogue of his compositions, in which he carefully
      entered every one of his works, until a short time before his death, with
      suggestions of the theme;<a href="#linknote-2700112"
      name="linknoteref-2700112" id="linknoteref-2700112"> 112 </a> at the same
      time he began to keep an account book of his income and expenditure. AndrÃ©
      observes as to this account, which unhappily I have not been able to see,
      that Mozart entered his receipts&mdash;which included the profits on some
      concerts, on lessons to different persons of rank, and on a few of his
      compositions&mdash;on a long piece of paper. His expenditure he noted in a
      little quarto book, which he afterwards used <span class="side">MOZART'S
      ACCOUNT-KEEPING.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p311.png">[311]</a></span>
      for writing English exercises and translations. His entries, while they
      lasted, were exact and minute. For instance, on one page we find:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      May 1, 1784. Two lilies of the valley... 1 kreutzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 27, 1784. A starling.........34 kreutzers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the following melody&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      with the remark, "Das war schÃ¶n!" It is easy to discover what so delighted
      him. On April 12 he had composed his pianoforte concerto in G major (453
      K.), and soon after played it in public. The subject of the rondo is:&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasure he felt at hearing it piped so comically altered induced him
      to buy the bird. He grew very much attached to his "Vogel Stahrl," as
      indeed he was to all animals, especially birds, and when it died he
      erected a gravestone to its memory in his garden, with an epitaph in
      verse.<a href="#linknote-2700113" name="linknoteref-2700113"
      id="linknoteref-2700113"> 113 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The excessive neatness of the account-books leads us to fear that they
      were not persevered with for any very long time, and indeed it is almost
      surprising that Mozart should have kept them for a whole year, from March,
      1784, to February, 1785. After that he handed them over to his wife, and
      the entries soon cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Niemetschek is right in saying that "even if the same indulgence
      be granted to Mozart that we must all wish to see extended to ourselves,
      he cannot be put forward as an example of carefulness and economy."
      Whoever, like Mozart, begins his housekeeping with nothing at all, or even
      with debts, and is dependent upon an uncertain and fluctuating income, has
      need of the strictest economy and regularity, amounting even to parsimony,
      if he is to extricate himself from his difficulties or attain to
      competence; otherwise occasional strokes of good fortune are seldom
      of use&mdash;indeed <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p312.png">[312]</a></span>
      are sometimes positive hindrances." Regularity and economy were, as we
      have seen, qualities not in Mozart's nature, and he never acquired them.
      Their absence sufficiently accounts for his constant financial
      embarrassments. He atoned for his errors and weakness by poverty and want,
      by sorrow and care, by shame and humiliation; he was spared none of the
      punishment which life ruthlessly inflicts on those who do not conform to
      the laws of her iron necessity. But death has wiped out the stain, and the
      misrepresentations of envious detractors and petty fault-finders have no
      power to touch that which is immortal.

      his marriage. It was not till after long opposition that Leopold Mozart
      voluntarily, although most unwillingly, gave his consent, and how deeply
      he was wounded will appear from the answer he made to a conciliatory
      letter addressed to him by the Baroness WaldstÃ¤dten (August 23, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank your ladyship most heartily for the interest you are pleased to
      take in my affairs, and more especially for your ladyship's extraordinary
      kindness in celebrating so handsomely my son's wedding-day.<a

      </a> When I was a young fellow I imagined that those were philosophers who
      spoke little, laughed seldom, and maintained a surly demeanour towards all
      the rest of mankind. But my own experience has now fully convinced me that
      I am myself a philosopher without knowing it; I have done my duty as a
      father&mdash;have made the clearest and most comprehensible statements in

      (as he has so willed it) to himself, and to pray the Almighty to bestow my
      paternal blessing on him, and not to withdraw His Divine mercy. As to
      myself, I will endeavour to preserve what remains of my native

      Putting ourselves in the place of Leopold Mozart, we must acknowledge that
      his reproaches and misgivings were in some respects well founded; but,
      nevertheless, he went too far in that he could not make up his mind to
      recognise his son's independence, and gave way to a bitterness of feeling
      which made him hard and unjust, and which, unhappily, was never altogether
      effaced from his heart. Wolfgang, on the contrary, betrayed no shadow of
      resentment&mdash;his love and reverence for his father remained the same
      to the end, unabated by unsparing and often unjust fault-finding. If his
      letters were less frequent or shorter than formerly he had ample excuses
      to offer, either of illness or the numerous occupations and distractions
      which were unavoidable in his position.<a href="#linknote-28003"
      name="linknoteref-28003" id="linknoteref-28003"> 3 </a> When, for any of
      these reasons, customary congratulations were neglected, an apology was
      sure to follow&mdash;for instance (January 4, 1783): "We both thank you
      heartily for your New Year's wishes, and willingly acknowledge ourselves
      stupid blockheads for having forgotten our duty in this respect; being so
      far behindhand, we will dispense altogether with a New Year's wish, only
      offering you our general every-day wish, and so let it pass." Being quite
      convinced that his Constanze could not fail to impress his father and
      sister favourably, and that personal acquaintance would efface all
      unpleasant feeling, he was very anxious to <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p314.png">[314]</a></span> take her to Salzburg as soon as
      possible. But many difficulties came in the way, for which his father did
      not always make due allowance. Mozart was particularly desirous of passing
      his father's fÃªte-day in Salzburg (November 15,1782), but the time was too
      short for him. He had promised to play at a concert for Fraulein
      Aurnhammer on November 3, and he must be in Vienna again at the beginning
      of December, that being the best season for lessons and concerts; to these
      objections might be added the impassable state of the roads, and such
      severe cold as rendered it undesirable to travel with his wife. In short,
      the journey must be postponed until the spring; in spring, however, the
      approaching confinement of his wife again put it out of the question. At
      the last moment Mozart invited his father to stand godfather (June 7,
      1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no idea that the joke would so soon turn into earnest, and therefore
      postponed falling on my knees, clasping my hands and humbly begging you,
      my dearest father, to stand godfather to my child. But as there may still
      be time for it, I do so now. Nevertheless, in sure hope that you will not
      refuse my request, I have taken care that in case of need somebody shall
      stand at the font in your name. Whether the child shall be <i>generis
      masculini or feminini!</i> it is to be called Leopold or Leopoldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the birth of the child,<a href="#linknote-28004"
      name="linknoteref-28004" id="linknoteref-28004"> 4 </a> however, at the
      end of July, 1783, they actually set out. Mozart and some of his friends
      had misgivings lest the Archbishop should seek to detain him in Salzburg,
      because he had never received any formal dismissal from service&mdash;"for
      a priest is capable of anything." With this idea, he proposed a meeting in

      Before Mozart was married, he had "made a vow in his heart" that, if he
      succeeded in bringing Constanze to Salzburg, he would compose a mass to be
      performed there. "A proof of the sincerity of this vow," he wrote to his
      father (January 4, 1783), "is afforded by the score of the half of <span
      class="side">VISIT TO SALZBURG, 1783.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p315.png">[315]</a></span> my mass, which is laying before
      me in full hope of completion." He took with him to Salzburg only the
      Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, and Benedictus, composed on a scale of great
      splendour (427 K.). The missing movements were probably supplied from an
      older mass, and the whole was rehearsed at the Kapellhaus on August 23,
      and performed at St. Peter's church (the Archbishop having apparently
      refused the cathedral) on August 25, Mozart's wife taking the soprano
      part.<a href="#linknote-28006" name="linknoteref-28006"

    <p>
      Mozart was not by any means idle during this visit to Salzburg. The
      revival of Italian opera had suggested to him to look about for a libretto
      for an opera buffa, and even before he came to Salzburg he had entered
      into negotiations with Varesco through his father. Varesco declaring
      himself quite ready, it only needed the visit to Salzburg to concert the
      plan of the opera, "L'Oca del Cairo." Varesco prepared a detailed account
      of the plot, and carried out the first act in full; Mozart set himself
      with equal zeal to its composition, and took back to Vienna a sketch of
      part of the act. We shall have to do later with the fate of this opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he found leisure for a service of love to Michael Haydn.
      Hadyn had been ordered by the Archbishop to compose some duets for violin
      and tenor, perhaps for his special use, but owing to a violent illness,
      which incapacitated him for work during a lengthened period, he was unable
      to finish them at the time appointed; the Archbishop thereupon threatened
      to deprive him of his salary. When Mozart heard of the difficulty he at
      once undertook the work, and, visiting Haydn daily, wrote by his bedside
      to such good purpose that the duets were soon completed and handed over to
      the Archbishop in Hadyn's name.<a href="#linknote-28007"
      name="linknoteref-28007" id="linknoteref-28007"> 7 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These two duets (423, 424, K.) show no signs of hasty composition, but are
      worked out with evident affection, partly no doubt from desire to do
      credit to himself and his friend, but partly also from the interest which
      the difficulties of the <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p316.png">[316]</a></span> task
      presented. There is no small amount of art required to give the clear-cut
      outline and well-defined divisions which are essential in works of this
      kind, and yet to bestow full attention on light and shade and delicate
      touches of detail. The art consists chiefly in the free disposition of
      parts, which is partly imitative (where independent movement is necessary)
      and so managed as also to bestow an original and striking character on the
      passages which form the accompaniment. This is all the more striking
      because the limited number of parts only occasionally gives scope for full
      harmonies, the effect of which must be attained by means of skilful
      adjustment. It is a task requiring all the resources of art and genius to
      employ the stiff monotony of broken chords, and at the same time to
      gratify the sense of hearing by such a sense of harmony as can only be
      given by the absolutely free play of the different parts. This task is
      here accomplished with as much ease as was compatible with the limited
      means at disposal. Variety in form is carefully provided for. The first
      Duet in G major consists of a broadly-designed allegro, a short, beautiful
      adagio, and an animated, but more than usually serious rondo; in the
      second, in B flat major, a light allegro is introduced by a short adagio;
      then follows an adagio in the form of a Siciliana, and the conclusion is
      made by very graceful variations. The melodies and harmonies are free and
      original, the composition is broad, fresh and lively, and a multitude of
      delicate touches betray the master's hand. Michael Haydn treasured the
      original as a memorial both of artist and friend, and Mozart himself set
      considerable store by the work.

      Mozart found several new inmates in his father's house. "My son is in
      Vienna, and intends to remain there," writes L. Mozart to Breitkopf (April
      29, 1782); "I have therefore arranged that two pupils shall reside with me
      for their education, viz., the son, twelve years of age, and the daughter,
      fourteen, of Herr Marchand, theatrical manager in Munich. I hope to make a
      great violinist and pianist of the boy, and a great singer and pianiste of
      the girl." These pupils were joined by another of nine years old, Johanna
      Brochard, daughter of the celebrated actress, who profited by L. <span

      and 1784.<a href="#linknote-28008" name="linknoteref-28008"
      id="linknoteref-28008"> 8 </a> Wolfgang took a lively interest in all this
      youthful talent. He says of Margarethe Marchand, whom he met afterwards in
      Munich as Frau Danzi (October 31, 1783): "Her grimaces and affectations
      are not always pleasant. Only blockheads would be taken in by them. I
      myself would rather have the most boorish manners than such exaggeration
      of coquetry." According to what we hear of her performances afterwards,
      she must have followed good advice and altered her style.<a

      Wolfgang took great interest in her brother Heinrich, and sent him word
      (December 6, 1783) that he had spoken in his favour both at Linz and
      Vienna. "Tell him to rely chiefly on his staccato; for that is the only
      way in which he can avoid comparison with La Motte at Vienna." There was
      also in Salzburg at that time the blind pianiste, Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Paradies,
      who was an acquaintance of L. Mozart, and now became known also to
      Wolfgang,<a href="#linknote-280010" name="linknoteref-280010"
      id="linknoteref-280010"> 10 </a> who afterwards wrote a concerto for her
      (Vol. II., p. 288). But the object of Mozart's visit, which lay nearest
      his heart, was the establishment of friendly relations between his wife
      and his father and sister; and this unfortunately in great measure failed.
      A superficial friendship seems to have resulted from the visit; but there
      are many indications that neither the father nor sister felt attracted by
      Constanze. Mozart appears to have been aggrieved that his wife was not
      presented with any of the trinkets that had been given him in his youth.<a
      href="#linknote-280011" name="linknoteref-280011" id="linknoteref-280011">
      11 </a> This trait is characteristic as a proof that Leopold Mozart
      thought himself justified in showing in the plainest manner disapproval of
      his son's marriage, and of the wife he had chosen; and it can scarcely be
      wondered at that Constanze, conscious of the want of anything like
      sympathy in her husband's family, should not have encouraged his sense of
      dependence on their advice and opinions. But this sense was too deeply
      implanted in his heart to be ever altogether eradicated; and his letters,
      though not so <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p318.png">[318]</a></span> frequent as
      formerly, continued to the end to breathe the same spirit of childlike
      love and reverence. After a stay of almost three months the young couple
      returned home. Mozart sends his father the following account of their
      journey from Linz:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived here safely yesterday, October 30, at nine o'clock in the
      morning. We passed the first night at BÃ¶cklbruck. The following forenoon
      we arrived at Lambach, and I was just in time to accompany the Agnus Dei
      of the office on the organ. The "Herr PrÃ¤lat" [who had received Mozart
      kindly in 1767] was very delighted at seeing me again. We remained there
      the whole day, and I played on the organ and a clavichord. I heard that at
      Ebersperg, on the following day, Herr Steurer was to give an operatic
      performance at which all Linz would be present, so I determined to proceed
      there at once. Young Count Thun (brother to the Thun at Vienna) called on
      me, and said that his father had been expecting me for the last fortnight,
      and that I was to stay with him. The next day, when we arrived at the gate
      of Linz, we were met by a servant to conduct us to the residence of old
      Count Thun. I cannot say enough of the politeness with which we are
      overwhelmed. On Tuesday, November 4, I shall give a concert in the theatre
      here, and as I have not a single symphony with me, I am writing one for
      dear life to be ready in time. My wife and I kiss your hands, and beg your
      forgiveness for having troubled you during so long a time; once more we
      thank you heartily for all the favours we received from you.<a
      href="#linknote-280012" name="linknoteref-280012" id="linknoteref-280012">
      12 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      What symphony it was which Mozart composed at Linz cannot be exactly
      ascertained. Holmes conjectures that it may be a Symphony in C major (425
      K., score 6), which, according to Niemetschek, was dedicated to Count
      Thun; this fact would support the conjecture. AndrÃ©, however, believes
      that the unprinted Symphony in G major (444 K.) may be the one composed in
      Linz, the more so as the score is in Mozart's handwriting only as far as
      the first half of the andante, and has then been completed by a copyist;
      this is very probable because Mozart, in order to gain time, only wrote
      out the parts of the last half, as was his custom when in haste. The
      smaller orchestra also, the narrower dimensions and the lighter character
      of this symphony, all point to it as the one in question; that in C major
      is more <span class="side">SYMPHONY COMPOSED FOR LINZ, 1783.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p319.png">[319]</a></span> striking and
      important both in style and treatment. Nevertheless the two symphonies
      both belong to the same time and style, and indicate in a curious way a
      transition in Mozart's instrumental music; the positive influence of
      Haydn's symphonies is nowhere so clearly apparent as in these two works.
      The very fact that in both cases the allegro is preceded by a pathetic,
      somewhat lengthy adagio is very significant; this is a well-known
      arrangement of Haydn's, but was only exceptionally made use of by Mozart.
      The same influence is visible everywhere; in the lively, rapid, and
      brilliant character of the whole, in the effort to please and amuse by
      humorous turns and unexpected contrasts of every kind in the harmonies, in
      the alternations of <i>f</i> and <i>p</i>, and in the instrumental
      effects. A remarkable instance of this is the andante of the Symphony in G
      major. The very theme, the simple bass, the triplet passage for the second
      violin, then the minor with the figure in the bass, and the sharp
      accentuation, are all completely Haydn-like features. The counterpoint of
      the finale of both symphonies reminds us of Haydn's manner.<a
      href="#linknote-280013" name="linknoteref-280013" id="linknoteref-280013">
      13 </a> It need scarcely be said, however, that there is no trace of
      servile imitation in either work, and that Mozart's originality asserts
      itself here as elsewhere. A comparison of the Symphony in E flat major
      (543 K., composed June 26, 1788) shows also many more points of
      resemblance to Haydn's style than other works of the same date; but
      Mozart's individuality is here so overpowering as to have given its
      distinguishing stamp to these very features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Mozart wrote a symphony within the course of a few days will
      excite no surprise; it is worthy of note that during his stay in Linz he
      copied an "Ecce Homo" which made a great impression on him, for his wife,
      with the inscription "DessinÃ© par W. A. Mozart, Linz, ce 13 Novembre,
      1783; dÃ©diÃ© Ã¤ Madame Mozart son Ã©pouse"; she <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p320.png">[320]</a></span> preserved it as a proof "that he
      had some talent for drawing," as she wrote to HÃ¤rtel (July 21, 1800).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1785 Leopold Mozart returned the visit of his son and
      daughter-in-law, and remained their guest from February 10 to April 25. He
      convinced himself that their income ought to be more than sufficient for
      the support of the household, and took great delight in his second
      grandchild Carl, now six months old, "a healthy, lively, merry child."
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the whole he appears to have been dissatisfied with his visit, and
      very little inclined to accede to Wolfgang's wish that he should take up
      his residence with them in Vienna.<a href="#linknote-280014"
      name="linknoteref-280014" id="linknoteref-280014"> 14 </a> His pleasure in
      his son's performance and admiration of his genius were as great as they
      had ever been. During the whole of his visit, one concert followed close
      on another, and Wolfgang was engaged almost as a matter of course for them
      all; his father took equal pride in his playing and his compositions. At
      one concert Wolfgang played the splendid concerto he had composed for
      Paradies (456 K.). "I had a very good box," writes his father to Marianne,
      "and could hear every gradation of the instruments so perfectly, that the
      tears came to my eyes for very joy"&mdash;so thoroughly did the old man
      appreciate and relish artistic beauty. The day after his father's arrival,
      Mozart invited Haydn to a quartet party at his house. On such occasions
      Mozart, who in later years discontinued his practice of the violin,
      usually took the tenor part. Kelly tells of a quartet party at Storace's,
      when Haydn took the first violin, Dittersdorf the second, Mozart tenor,
      and Van-hall violoncello&mdash;a cast unique of its kind.<a
      href="#linknote-280015" name="linknoteref-280015" id="linknoteref-280015">
      15 </a> L. Mozart writes to his daughter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They played three of the new quartets, those in B flat, A, and C major
      (458, 464,465 K.). They are perhaps a little easier than the other three,
      <span class="side">L. MOZART'S VISIT TO VIENNA, 1785.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p321.png">[321]</a></span> but admirable
      compositions. Herr Haydn said to me: "<i>I assure you solemnly and as an
      honest man, that I consider your son to be the greatest composer of whom I
      have ever heard; he has taste, and possesses a thorough knowledge of
      composition.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      L. Mozart knew the value of such an opinion from such a man; it afforded
      him a confirmation of his faith, and of the conviction to which he had
      sacrificed the best powers of his life. Such a testimony to his son's
      genius was the father's best reward, and one of the brightest spots of his
      life. L. Mozart obtained much credit also through his pupil Heinrich
      Marchand, who accompanied him, and played with great success at several
      concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were other entertainments and enjoyments altogether wanting. He heard
      Aloysia Lange, whose beautiful voice had once been a source of anxiety to
      him, in Gluck's "Pilgrims of Mecca" and in GrÃ©try's "Zemire and Azor" (her
      favourite part): "She sang and played admirably on both occasions." He
      visited the Baroness WaldstÃ¤dten, whose acquaintance had gratified him so
      much, in the convent of Neuburg, where she was then staying; but we do not
      hear anything of the future course of their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an important fact, and one of grave significance in the case of a
      man of L. Mozart's tone of mind and thought, that he was led by his son's
      influence to enter the order of Freemasonry. The strong national feeling
      which existed in him, side by side with devotion to the tenets of his
      church, regulating his conception of moral duties, and influencing all his
      critical judgments, makes it conceivable that he should seek for
      enlightenment through an association which numbered among its members some
      of the most considerable and highly esteemed of his friends. I am not
      aware how far he was satisfied by the disclosures made to him, nor whether
      he remained an active member of the order after his return to Salzburg;
      his daughter saw grounds for believing that his subsequent correspondence
      with Wolfgang turned mainly on topics connected with Freemasonry. From
      Vienna Leopold Mozart travelled by way of Munich, where he had a pleasant
      visit, back to Salzburg. There he found awaiting him an announcement from
      his gracious master <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p322.png">[322]</a></span> that,
      as he had already exceeded his six weeks' leave of absence, if he did not
      report himself before the middle of May, "no salary should be paid to him
      until further notice." We can enter into the complaints he made to his
      daughter of the dulness of his life in Salzburg. He never saw his son
      again. A faint hope, expressed to Marianne (September 16, 1785), that
      Wolfgang, not having written for a considerable time, meant to surprise
      him with a visit, was not fulfilled; he himself, accompanied by Heinrich
      Marchand, paid a flying visit to Munich in February, 1787, but did not go
      on to Vienna. His paternal pride was gratified by the intelligence of
      Wolfgang's brilliant success in Prague; and he did not neglect to inform
      his daughter when Pater Edmund, who had been on a visit to Vienna,
      declared on his return that Wolfgang had the reputation of being the first
      of living musicians (February 3, 1786). He watched with anxious sympathy
      over the course of his son's worldly affairs, but refused with consistent
      severity any substantial support, the right to which Wolfgang had clearly
      forfeited by his independent attitude; paternal advice, in its most
      unsparing form, was always at his service. Leopold Mozart transferred to
      his daughter the tenderness and active participation which was now denied
      to him in his intercourse with his distant son. Thus he remained to the
      end true to his principles, but not untouched by the weakness and
      suffering of old age; he answers one of Marianne's anxious inquiries after
      his health (February 24, 1787):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man must not expect anything like perfect health; he is always
      failing, and loses strength just as a young man gains it. One must just
      patch oneself up as long as one can. We may hope for a little improvement
      from the better weather now. You will, of course, find me very much
      thinner, but, after all, that is of no consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had still a pleasure to come in the visit of the Storaces and Kelly;
      Mdlle. Storace had packed up Wolfgang's letter intrusted to her so
      carefully, that she could not get at it, but verbal intercourse with such
      intimate friends of his son must have been ample compensation for this.
      Soon afterwards he fell ill, on hearing which Wolfgang wrote as follows
      (April 4, 1787):&mdash;

      I have this moment heard what has quite overwhelmed me&mdash;all the more
      since your last letter allowed me to imagine that you were quite well&mdash;and
      now I hear that you are really ill! How earnestly I long for reassuring
      news from your own hand, I do not need to tell you, and I confidently hope
      for it, although I have learnt to make it my custom to imagine the worst
      of everything. Since death (properly speaking) is the true end of life, I
      have accustomed myself during the last two years to so close a
      contemplation of this, our best and truest friend, that he possesses no
      more terrors for me; nothing but peace and consolation! and I thank God
      for enabling me to discern in death the <i>key</i> to our true
      blessedness. I never lie down in bed without remembering that perhaps,
      young as I am, I may never see another day; and yet no one who knows me
      can say that I am melancholy or fanciful. For this blessing I thank God
      daily, and desire nothing more than to share it with my fellow men. I
      wrote to you on this point in the letter which Mdlle. Storace failed to
      deliver <i>Ã¤ propos</i> of the death of my dearest friend Count von
      Hatzfeld; he was thirty-one&mdash;just my own age; I do not mourn for him,
      but for myself, and all those who knew him as I did. I hope and pray that
      even as I write this you may be already better; but if, contrary to all
      expectation, this should not be the case, I conjure you by all that we
      hold most sacred, not to hide the truth from me, but to write at once, in
      order that I may be in your arms with the least possible delay. But I hope
      soon to receive a reassuring letter from yourself, and in this hope,
    </p>
    <p>
      I, with my wife and Carl, kiss your hands a thousand times, and am ever,&mdash;Your
      most dutiful son.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter puts the seal on the beautiful, genuinely human relations
      existing between the father and son; in the presence of death, they stand
      face to face like men, calm in the assurance that true love and earnest
      efforts after truth and goodness reach beyond the limits of our earthly
      existence. Leopold Mozart apparently recovered from this attack, and wrote
      to his daughter on May 26, that he should expect her and her family to
      spend Whitsuntide with him; but this pleasure was denied to him. On May
      28, 1787, a sudden death<a href="#linknote-280016"
      name="linknoteref-280016" id="linknoteref-280016"> 16 </a> ended the
      career of a man who had accomplished, by means of a singular union of
      shrewdness and industry, of love and severity, the difficult task of
      educating a child of genius into an artist.

      The personal relationships which resulted from Mozart's marriage not only
      affected his mental and social condition, but had also considerable
      influence on him as a composer; it is indispensable therefore to take them
      into account in any consideration of his artistic career.

      His relations with his mother-in-law were, as might have been expected,
      unfavourable enough at first. She did not indeed live in the same house
      with them, as Mozart writes for his father's consolation (August 31,
      1782);<a href="#linknote-280017" name="linknoteref-280017"
      id="linknoteref-280017"> 17 </a> but even at the second visit which he
      paid her with his wife, she scolded and disputed until Constanze was
      reduced to tears, and they resolved in consequence only to visit her on
      family fÃªte-days. This state of affairs was afterwards improved, since we
      can well understand that it was impossible for a man of Mozart's genial
      and loving nature to keep up offence. "Mozart and our late mother became
      more and more attached to each other," writes Sophie Haibl. "He used often
      to come running to our house with little packets of coffee and sugar,
      saying as he handed them out: 'Here, mamma dear, take a little <i>Jause</i>'
      (afternoon coffee). He never came to us empty-handed." Constanze's
      youngest sister, Sophie, was in very frequent intercourse with them; her
      sister's constant illness rendered her help in nursing, which she was
      always most willing to bestow, quite invaluable; and during Mozart's last
      illness we find her constant in attendance at his bedside. Mozart's
      intercourse with Aloysia Lange and her husband<a href="#linknote-280018"
      name="linknoteref-280018" id="linknoteref-280018"> 18 </a> seems to have
      been friendly and unembarrassed. The Langes did not live happily together,
      and though Lange himself laid the blame upon backbiters,<a
      href="#linknote-280019" name="linknoteref-280019" id="linknoteref-280019">
      19 </a> it was notorious that their disunion arose from his unreasonable
      jealousy, a jealousy for which his wife had <span class="side">MOZART AND
      MADAME LANGE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p325.png">[325]</a></span>
      far more cause than he.<a href="#linknote-280020" name="linknoteref-280020"
      id="linknoteref-280020"> 20 </a> But as far as Mozart was concerned
      Lange's jealousy must have been unprovoked, or he would hardly have taken
      the part of Pierrot in the pantomime already noticed (Vol. II., p. 304),
      allowing his wife to play Columbine to Mozart's Harlequin. She
      acknowledged later that, as a young girl, she had under-estimated Mozart's
      genius, and she learnt to look upon his music with admiration and
      reverence, and upon himself with friendship and esteem.<a
      href="#linknote-280021" name="linknoteref-280021" id="linknoteref-280021">
      21 </a> We find many indications in the letters of friendly intercourse
      between the Mozarts and the Langes. It was natural, therefore, that they
      should have afforded each other professional help whenever opportunity
      arose. On April 10, 1782, Mozart composed a song (383 K.)<a
      href="#linknote-280022" name="linknoteref-280022" id="linknoteref-280022">
      22 </a> for his sister-in-law, the words of which show it to have been
      intended for a benefit performance by way of farewell:&mdash;

      Whether Madame Lange was about to leave Vienna on a tour, or had merely
      come to the end of an engagement, I cannot say. The composition (in G
      major) takes the form of a ballad in two verses, and is very simple, easy
      and pleasing. Original features are not wanting, as for instance,
      suspensions and transition notes on an organ point, which even modern
      musicians would find piquant. The accompaniment is easy, but delicate; the
      stringed instruments play <i>pizzicato</i> throughout, a device not often
      employed by Mozart; the flutes, oboe, and bassoon, employed as solo
      instruments, but without any bravura, enliven the simple design. In the
      following year (January 8) he composed a Rondo (416 K., part 1), "Mia
      speranza adorata," which she first sang at a concert at the Mehlgrube; the
      distinguishing qualities of this song are delicacy and tenderness; it
      depends for effect more upon a sympathetic delivery than on the compass
      and <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p326.png">[326]</a></span> executive
      powers of the singer. In March of the same year, Madame Lange and Mozart
      mutually supported each other at their concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the revival of the Italian opera, it often happened that Mozart was
      requested to compose detached pieces for insertion. When, in 1783,
      Anfossi's opera of "Il Curioso Indiscreto," composed in 1778, was
      represented, Madame Lange and Adamberger, who, as German singers, had to
      contend with much opposition, knew that they could not fail to make an
      effect in music of Mozart's composition, and begged him to write two songs
      for their <i>dÃ©but</i>. He was, as ever, quite ready to grant their
      request; but he had yet to learn that even in Italian opera he could not
      assert his claims without opposition. We have his own account in a letter
      to his father (July 2, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera was given the day before yesterday, Monday; none of it pleased
      except my two songs, and the second, a bravura song, was encored. But you
      must know that my enemies were ill-natured enough to spread about
      beforehand that Mozart had undertaken to correct Anfossi's opera. I heard
      of this, and sent word to Count Rosenberg that
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not produce the songs unless the following notice in German and
      Italian was printed in the opera-book: "Notice.&mdash;The two songs, page
      36 and page 102, are composed, not by Signor Anfossi, but by Herr Mozart,
      at the desire of Madame Lange. This announcement is made out of respect
      and consideration for the fame of the celebrated Neapolitan composer."
      This was done, and I handed over the songs, which did as much credit to
      myself as to my sister-in-law.<a href="#linknote-280023"
      name="linknoteref-280023" id="linknoteref-280023"> 23 </a> So my enemies
      are caught in their own trap! Now I must tell you of one of Salieri's
      tricks, which did not hurt me so much as poor Adamberger. I think I wrote
      to you that I had also composed a rondo for Adamberger. At one of the
      early rehearsals, before the rondo was ready, Salieri called Adamberger
      aside, and told him that Count Rosenberg was not pleased at the idea of
      his inserting a song, and he should advise him as a friend to abandon it.
      Adamberger, exasperated against Rosenberg, answered with a stupid display
      of ill-timed pride: "I flatter myself that Adamberger's fame is so well
      established in Vienna that he has no need to seek the favour of the public
      by songs written on purpose for him; I shall sing what is in the <span
      class="side">ARIE FOR ALOYSIA LANGE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p327.png">[327]</a></span> opera, and never insert any song
      as long as I live." And what was the consequence? Why, that he made no
      effect at all, and now repents, but too late; for, if he were to come to
      me to-day for the rondo, I would not give it to him. I can use it very
      well in one of my own operas. But what most provokes him is that my
      prophecy and his wife's turns out correct, viz., that neither Count
      Rosenberg nor the manager knew a word of the affair, so that he was simply
      tricked by Salieri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adamberger might certainly have made a brilliant display of his powers in
      the song (420 K., part 8) "Per pietÃ¤ non ricercata."<a
      href="#linknote-280024" name="linknoteref-280024" id="linknoteref-280024">
      24 </a> It is broad in design, and affords the singer opportunities for a
      display of voice, delivery, and execution; it maintains a certain dignity
      of tone throughout. A very effective use is made of the wind instruments;
      and a comparison of their full satisfying sound with that of the wind
      instruments in the song quoted (Vol. II., pp. 232, 233) will show how
      closely connected in a true work of art are the tone-colouring of the
      instruments and the nature and development of the motifs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of Madame Lange's two songs, "Vorrei spiegarvi, oh Dio!" (418
      K.), was composed on June 20, and is broad in outline, the first slow
      movement in especial being delicately elaborated in detail. It expresses
      the painful hesitatation of a mourner who would fain express her grief,
      but dares not; and this idea is well expressed by the broken phrases of
      the voice part, leaving the thread of the music to be carried on by the
      accompanying orchestra. A simple accompaniment, delivered pizzicato by the
      second violins and tenors, forms the canvas for the design, in which the
      oboe supports the principal motif, sometimes accompanying the voice,
      sometimes relieving it; an easy figure twines round the chief subject,
      sustained throughout by the first violins muted; while the horns and
      bassoons in sustained chords give consistency and shading to the whole.
      The situation and subject of the song necessitate restless and varied
      modulation; and this opening movement affords an example of Mozart's art
      in projecting a design and maintaining it <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p328.png">[328]</a></span> throughout with the utmost
      delicacy and variety of detail. The allegro which follows is more directly
      suggestive of opera buffa in its impulsive haste and in its dramatic
      characterisation; but the skill is worthy of note with which the elevated
      tone of the first movement is preserved and the bravura of the singer is
      placed in the most favourable light.<a href="#linknote-280025"
      name="linknoteref-280025" id="linknoteref-280025"> 25 </a> The second
      song, "No che non sei capace" (419 K.), which is allotted to the same
      character, Clorinda, is a bravura song, in the very fullest acceptation of
      the term. The passages of two allegro movements mount to the highest
      heights like rockets, bursting from a ground-work of declamatory and
      dignified melody. The orchestra, too, is tolerably noisy, but so managed
      as always to spare the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart was very much gratified when the Langes selected his "EntfÃ¼hrung
      aus dem Serail" for their benefit performance prior to a month's leave of
      absence, and he takes care to acquaint his father with the fact (December
      10, 1783).<a href="#linknote-280026" name="linknoteref-280026"
      id="linknoteref-280026"> 26 </a> The choice was of course made chiefly in
      their own interests, since the opera was a favourite, and the part of
      Constanze might have been written for Madame Lange. Kelly, who admired her
      as one of the first vocalists of the day, and repeats Stephen Storace's
      comparison of her voice and execution to those of the Bastardella, was of
      opinion that the part of Constanze was of "the exact compass" for her
      voice.<a href="#linknote-280027" name="linknoteref-280027"

      id="linknoteref-280030"> 30 </a>

    <p>
      Mozart wrote another song for her on March 14, 1788 (538 K.), "Ah se in
      ciel benigne stelle" (from Metastasio's "Eroe Cinese,") apparently as a
      concert-piece. It is long and elaborate, well calculated to display great
      compass of voice, and more of bravura than the previous songs; but, as
      regards invention and mechanism, it is of less importance than those
      already noticed. It is not wanting in interesting harmonic details nor in
      expressive passages, but they stand apart, and are not blended into a
      harmonious whole in Mozart's usual manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very favourable idea of Aloysia's vocal powers may be formed from the
      songs composed for her in Vienna; the promise of the young girl had been
      amply fulfilled.<a href="#linknote-280031" name="linknoteref-280031"

      The flexibility of the voice appears to have been cultivated to an
      astonishing degree in every direction, and though the merit was chiefly
      Mozart's that these passages were interesting, expressive, and in good
      taste, yet their execution required a cultivated and accomplished singer.
      Hufeland wrote in 1783 that Madame Lange's voice was one of the finest he
      <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIEND.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p330.png">[330]</a></span> had ever heard, unusually
      pleasing and sympathetic, although somewhat weak for the stage,<a
      href="#linknote-280032" name="linknoteref-280032" id="linknoteref-280032">
      32 </a> and in this judgment Cramer concurs.<a href="#linknote-280033"
      name="linknoteref-280033" id="linknoteref-280033"> 33 </a> It was no doubt
      from consideration for the distinctive tone-colouring of the voice that
      Mozart did not make use of the whole body of wind instruments,
      particularly not of the clarinets, but allowed the gentler oboe to
      predominate in the accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's eldest sister-in-law, Josepha, made her first appearance as a
      singer at Schikaneder's theatre, after her marriage with the violinist
      Hofer. With the exception of a high and flexible voice (a common
      inheritance, apparently, of all the Webers), she had no special gifts nor
      musical cultivation, and Mozart seems to have taken great pains in
      practising her parts with her. He wrote a bravura song for her on
      September 17, 1789 (580 K.), "Schon lacht der holde FrÃ¼hling," which she,
      as Rosina, was to insert in the German adaptation of Paesiello's "Barber
      of Seville"; only portions of the score remain. It has no special
      significance, and reminds us in its embellishments of the Queen of Night's
      songs, which it resembles in other respects. Mozart interested himself
      also in his brother-in-law Hofer, studying his quartets with him, although
      Hofer was an indifferent musician; he took him with him on his last
      professional journey to Frankfort, that the name of Mozart might
      facilitate his public appearance, and be of use to him in his very narrow
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart was always ready to lend a helping hand, even where family
      considerations had no influence. When Nancy Storace, the original Susanna,
      in "Figaro," was leaving Vienna, he composed for her the beautiful song
      with obbligato pianoforte (505 K., part 6), which he played himself at her
      concert.<a href="#linknote-280034" name="linknoteref-280034"
      id="linknoteref-280034"> 34 </a> He selected the words of the song which
      had been composed for Idamante in the Vienna performance of "Idomeneo,"
      "Non temer amato bene." The circumstance that Idamante addresses laments
      and endearments to Ilia, who is <span class="side">OCCASIONAL
      COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p331.png">[331]</a></span>
      present, perhaps suggested the appropriateness of an obbligato
      accompaniment, and, in point of fact, the piano part represents the lover
      in the most charming and expressive manner, appearing now to assent, now
      to reply to the expressions of the singer. In this respect, as well as in
      its tone and sentiment, this song is far in advance of the earlier one
      with obbligato violin; the spirit of "Figaro" moves over it, and we seem
      to recognise the depth of feeling and the tinge of sentimentality which
      characterise the Countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's comparative failure in his attempt to insert songs in Anfossi's
      "Curioso Indiscreto" did not prevent his coming forward as soon as another
      opportunity of the same kind offered itself. On November 28, 1785,
      Bianchi's "Villanella Rapita" was produced for the first time, and Mozart
      was induced to give the opera the support of some ensemble movements of
      his composition.<a href="#linknote-280035" name="linknoteref-280035"
      id="linknoteref-280035"> 35 </a> The beautiful Celestine Coltellini

      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p332.png">[332]</a></span> prominent in
      Mozart's charming terzet and quartet; her part is that of a peasant-girl,
      simple even to silliness, who receives presents from a Count, without
      being in the least aware of his intentions, nor of the rage and jealousy
      of her betrothed and her father. In the terzet (450 K.&mdash;(Probably 480
      K. DW)) "Mandina amabile" (composed November 21, 1785), the delight with
      which she accepts the money, and, at the request of the Count, gives him
      her hand with the words, "Ecco servitevi!" is not given with any
      particular refinement by the poet; but Mozart has thrown so much grace and
      roguery into the action that it becomes an excellent point for a clever
      actress. The opening has a certain resemblance to the duet between Don
      Giovanni and Zerlina, although the latter stands several degrees higher,
      in accordance with the different characters of the personages; a
      comparison of the two pieces affords a proof of Mozart's skill in basing
      his characterisation on the conditions of the dramatic situation. Even
      when the lover interferes with jealous violence, and the Count seeks to
      excuse himself with as good a grace as possible, she fails to perceive
      what is passing before her; and Mozart does not neglect the opportunity of
      combining these opposing elements into a well-proportioned animated whole.
      The effect is excellent when the key, after the duet has pursued its
      rollicking course in A major and the nearly related keys, passes into A
      minor, and then with rapid transition into C major; even when it has
      reverted into A major the minor key constantly recurs in discords
      suggestive of jealousy. The quartet (479 K.) "Dite almeno, in che mancai"
      (composed November 15, 1785), has a less strongly marked situation.
      Mandina confronts her indignant lover and father with innocent simplicity;
      when the Count enters, a violent altercation arises between the men, of
      which she cannot understand the cause, but, anxious at any sacrifice to
      restore peace, she begs with really touching earnestness for pity and
      forgiveness. Her calmness, in opposition to the voluble excitement of the
      men, gives the movement its distinguishing character, which it was the
      task of the performer to throw into relief; her part, especially in the
      tender and beseeching passages, is full of feeling and charm. As to <span
      class="side">MUSIC FOR THE "VILLANELLA RAPITA," 1785.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p333.png">[333]</a></span> the other
      parts, the ever-increasing tumult of an animated dispute is represented
      with very simple, well-calculated expedients in a manner which is
      thoroughly Italian; a striking instance of this is the joining in of the
      orchestra when the wrangling is at its height, with the preservation of
      all the delicate comic effects. The masterly treatment of the orchestra,
      both in detail and in effects of grouping, would alone suffice to raise
      these two pieces far above similar movements of the then commonly received
      opera buffa type. More excellent even than the brilliant and
      characteristic sound effects is the independent and copious construction
      of the instrumental parts, which nevertheless are kept within their proper
      provinces as foils to the voices. Of the voice parts it need scarcely be
      said that they are delicately and characteristically treated, and move
      freely and with animation side by side, producing at the same time an
      effective whole. There is no bravura, and the treatment of the voices
      indicates moderate capabilities on the part of the singers. Coltellini's
      part never goes above&mdash;[See Page Image]

      rarely so high, and calls for no great amount of execution. Among the male
      singers Mandini was by far the most important; the part of Almaviva was
      afterwards written for him, and the passionate expressions of the lover
      Pippo in the terzet remind us of that part. The tenor Calvesi (Count) and
      the second bass Bussani (Biaggio) were of less account. These ensemble
      pieces were the mature and graceful products of Mozart's fully developed
      genius, and nothing but their simplicity of design and construction points
      them out as pieces inserted in an opera, and dependent upon it for their
      peculiar character.

      We can well believe that Mozart composed songs to please the singers, male
      and female, who appeared in his operas. He was not only ready to write
      additional pieces for them in his own operas, but frequently offered songs
      as an acknowledgment to the performers who sang for him. Louise Villeneuve
      appeared on June 27, 1789, as a new performer <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p334.png">[334]</a></span> in Martin's "Arbore di Diana,"
      and was received with well-deserved and genuine applause on account of her
      pleasing appearance, her expressive acting, and her artistically beautiful
      singing.<a href="#linknote-280041" name="linknoteref-280041"
      id="linknoteref-280041"> 41 </a> When she was about to appear as Dorabella
      in "Cosi fan tutte," in August, 1789, Mozart wrote for her an aria to
      Cimarosa's opera, "I Due Baroni" (578 K.), "Alma grande e nobil cuore," of
      forcible expression without making any great demands on the voice.<a
      href="#linknote-280042" name="linknoteref-280042" id="linknoteref-280042">
      42 </a> More original, although not very deep, are the two songs composed
      for the same singer in October, 1789, for insertion in Martin's "Burbero
      di Buon Cuore." The first (582 K.), "Chi sa, chi sa quai sia," is a single
      andante movement very moderate in tone. The second (583 K.), "Vado, ma
      dove," begins with a short, passionate allegro, with which is connected an
      andante simple in design and construction, but with a wonderfully
      beautiful and expressive cantilene, the effect of which is much heightened
      by the splendid instrumentation.

      A bass song, composed for Signor Franc. Albertarelli in Anfossi's "Le
      Gelosie Fortunate" (May,1788), was occasioned by the singer's connection
      with the performance of "Don Giovanni." It is a cheerful, thoroughly buffo
      aria, and the principal melody&mdash;[See Page Image] has been employed
      again by Mozart, with a slight but expressive alteration, in the first
      movement of the C major 1 symphony, the only instance of the kind known to
      me. Similar demands were made upon Mozart's generosity when he came into
      connection with Schikaneder's theatre. He composed (March 8,1791) for the
      bass singer, Gerl, who sang Sarastro in the "Zauberflote," an aria (612
      K.), "Per questa bella mano," with an obbligato double-bass accompaniment,
      <span class="side">OCCASIONAL COMPOSITIONS, 1788.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p335.png">[335]</a></span> which was
      played by Pischlberger with extraordinary execution. The combination
      reminds us of other similar Schikaneder-like effects, and the interest of
      the song depends mainly on the executive powers of the double-bass player,
      which are nevertheless confined within narrow limits. The limitation has
      in some degree influenced the treatment of the voice part, and this
      pleasing and, for a powerful bass voice, effective song can only be
      regarded as a curious occasional piece. Another occasional composition is
      Gleim's German war song, "Ich mÃ¶chte wohl der Kaiser sein"<a
      href="#linknote-280043" name="linknoteref-280043" id="linknoteref-280043">
      43 </a> (539 K.), composed March 5, 1788, for performance by the favourite
      comedian, Friedrich Baumann, jun., at a concert in the LeopoldstÃ¤dter
      Theatre on March 7, with special reference, no doubt, to the Turkish war
      which had just broken out.<a href="#linknote-280044"
      name="linknoteref-280044" id="linknoteref-280044"> 44 </a> This accounts
      for the running accompaniment of Turkish music to an otherwise simple and

      id="linknoteref-280045"> 45 </a> To sum up: it would appear that during
      Mozart's residence in Vienna, from 1781 to 1791, he completed five
      ensemble movements of different kinds, besides at least thirty separate
      songs for various occasions,<a href="#linknote-280046"
      name="linknoteref-280046" id="linknoteref-280046"> 46 </a> among which

      His genius was at the service of others besides vocalists. We have already
      seen that he wrote a pianoforte concerto for the blind performer Mdlle.
      Paradies (Vol. II., p. 288). An artist similarly afflicted from early
      youth was Marianne Kirchgassner (b. 1770), who had attained extraordinary
      proficiency on the harmonica under Schmittbauer's instruction.<a
      href="#linknote-280047" name="linknoteref-280047" id="linknoteref-280047">
      47 </a> When, in the course of a grand professional tour, she came to
      Vienna (May, 1791) she excited Mozart's interest so greatly <span
      class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p336.png">[336]</a></span> by her playing, that he composed
      a quintet for her, which she frequently afterwards performed with great
      success.<a href="#linknote-280048" name="linknoteref-280048"
      id="linknoteref-280048"> 48 </a> The combination of instruments&mdash;flute,
      oboe, tenor, and violoncello, with the harmonica&mdash;produces an
      originality of sound effect which is seriously impaired when, as usually
      happens, the piano is substituted for the harmonica. The latter instrument
      is limited in compass, having no bass notes,<a href="#linknote-280049"
      name="linknoteref-280049" id="linknoteref-280049"> 49 </a> and requires
      for its due effect a melodious and expressive style of execution. Mozart
      has given the adagio a sentimental, love-sick tone, which is sometimes a
      good deal overdrawn, but the second movement is cheerful and pleasing,
      and, without forming too strong a contrast, it leads to a sound and
      agreeable conclusion. With just discrimination he has given the piece a
      very well-defined and firmly constructed form, relying for original effect
      on the tone-colouring and harmonic transitions, which are often extremely
      bold.

      Mozart gave his support to another young artist, who had no such claim to
      pity as the two just mentioned. Regina Strinasacchi, of Ostiglia
      (1764-1839), was a pretty, amiable girl, and an accomplished
      violin-player, who came to Vienna in 1784. Mozart extols her taste and
      feeling to his father, who confirmed the praise when Strinasacchi appeared
      at Salzburg in December, 1785: "Every note is played with expression, even
      in symphonies, and I have never heard a more moving adagio than hers; her
      whole heart and soul is in the melody which she delivers, and her power
      and beauty of tone are equally remarkable.<a href="#linknote-280050"
      name="linknoteref-280050" id="linknoteref-280050"> 50 </a> I believe, as a
      rule, that a woman of genius plays with more expression than a man." <span

      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p337.png">[337]</a></span> "I am just

      name="linknoteref-280051" id="linknoteref-280051"> 51 </a> which we shall
      play together at her concert on Thursday" (April 24, 1784). But the sonata
      was not ready in time, and Strinasacchi with difficulty extorted her own
      part from Mozart the evening before the concert, and practised it without
      him on the following morning; they only met at the concert. Both played
      excellently, and the sonata was much applauded.<a href="#linknote-280052"
      name="linknoteref-280052" id="linknoteref-280052"> 52 </a> The Emperor
      Joseph, who was present, thought he could distinguish through his glass
      that Mozart had no music before him; he had him summoned and requested him
      to bring the sonata. It was blank music paper divided into bars, Mozart
      having had no time to write out the clavier part, which he thus played
      from memory, without even having heard the sonata.<a
      href="#linknote-280053" name="linknoteref-280053" id="linknoteref-280053">

    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart found an old Salzburg acquaintance at Vienna in the person of the
      horn-player Joseph Leutgeb. He had settled in Vienna, as Leopold Mozart
      writes (December 1, 1777), and bought a "snail-shell of a house" in one of
      the suburbs, upon credit; here he set up business as a cheesemonger, from
      the profits of which he promised to repay a loan, which, however, was
      still owing when Wolfgang came to Vienna; he begs his father's indulgence
      for Leutgeb, who was then wretchedly poor (May 8, 1782). He was a capital
      solo-player on the French horn,<a href="#linknote-280054"
      name="linknoteref-280054" id="linknoteref-280054"> 54 </a> but was wanting
      in higher cultivation. Mozart was always ready to help him, but he
      frequently made him the butt of his exuberant sprits. Whenever he composed
      a solo for him, Leutgeb was obliged to submit to some mock penance. Once,
      for instance, Mozart threw all the parts of his concertos and symphonies
      about the room, and Leutgeb had to collect them on all fours and put them
      in order; as long as this lasted Mozart sat at his <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p338.png">[338]</a></span> writing-table composing. Another
      time, Leutgeb had to kneel down behind the stove while Mozart wrote.<a
      href="#linknote-280055" name="linknoteref-280055" id="linknoteref-280055">
      55 </a> The manuscripts themselves bear traces of good-humoured banter.
      One (417 K.) has the superscription: "Wolfgang AmadÃ© Mozart takes pity on
      Leutgeb, ass, ox, and simpleton, at Vienna, March 27, 1783"; another (495
      K.) is written alternately with black, red, blue, and green ink. While he
      is writing down a rondo he amusingly imagines the player before him, and
      keeps up a running commentary on the supposed performance. The tempo, too,
      is jokingly indicated as adagio for the horn part, while the accompaniment
      is allegro; Leutgeb's inclination to drag is alluded to in the remark at
      the close of the ritornello: "A lei Signor Asino"&mdash;in the
      ejaculations on the theme: "Animo&mdash;presto&mdash;sÃ¹ via&mdash;da bravo&mdash;coraggio&mdash;e
      finisci giÃ¤" (at the conclusion). He goes on the same strain: "Bestia&mdash;oh
      che stonatura&mdash;chi&mdash;oimÃ¨ (at a repeatedly recurring F sharp)&mdash;bravo
      poveretto! &mdash;Oh seccatura di coglioni! (when the subject recurs)&mdash;ah
      che mi fai ridere!&mdash;ajuto (at a repeated E flat)&mdash;respira un
      poco! (at a pause)&mdash;avanti, avanti!&mdash;questo poi va al meglio
      (when the theme reappears)&mdash;e non finisci nemmeno?&mdash;ah porco
      infame! Oh come sei grazioso!&mdash;Carino! Asinino! hahaha&mdash;respira!&mdash;Ma
      intoni almeno una, cazzo! (at a repeated C sharp)&mdash;bravo, ewiva!&mdash;e
      vieni Ã¤ seccarmi per la quarta, e Dio sia benedetto per l' ultima volta
      (at the fourth repetition of the theme)&mdash;ah termina, ti prego! ah
      maledetto &mdash;anche bravura? (at a short run) bravo&mdash;ah! trillo di
      pecore (at a shake)&mdash;finisci? grazie al ciel!&mdash;basta, basta!"
      Leutgeb was quite willing to submit to his friend's banter as the price of
      four concertos (412, 417, 447, 495, cf. also 514 K.). They are rapidly put
      together and easy of execution, without any great originality. Their
      brevity enables the instrument to preserve its true character as one
      unsuited for display of execution; in the last movement, which is the
      regulation rondo in 6-8 time, the original nature of the horn as a hunting
      instrument is made apparent, which at that <span class="side">CLARINET
      CONCERTO, 1791.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p339.png">[339]</a></span>
      time, when hunting music was thought more of than at present, was no doubt
      found very entertaining. In other respects, the customary concerto form is
      preserved. The first movement is an allegro in sonata form, kept within
      narrow limits, the second is a simple romanza, followed by the rondo. The
      accompaniment is simple, to allow due prominence to the horn as the solo
      instrument, but Mozart seldom refrains from adding touches of life and
      character to the whole by means of a freer movement in the accompaniment.
      The quintet for the horn, violin, two tenors, and bass (407 K.), was also
      written for Leutgeb, who possessed the autograph.<a href="#linknote-280056"
      name="linknoteref-280056" id="linknoteref-280056"> 56 </a> The horn part
      is throughout concertante, the stringed instruments serve only as
      accompaniment, but are very independent and characteristic, so that the
      whole has some approach to the quartet style. The piece is altogether more
      important and finer than the concertos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far more important both as to compass and substance is the concerto for
      clarinet in A major (622 K.), which Mozart wrote or adapted for Stadler,
      towards the close of his life (between September 28 and November 15,
      1791). There exist six pages of a draft score of the first movement,
      composed much earlier for the basset-horn, in G major, and available for
      the clarinet with a few alterations in the deeper notes. It has not been
      ascertained whether this concerto was ever finished, but it is scarcely
      probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be expected that Mozart, who was the first to do justice to the
      capabilities of the clarinet as a solo instrument, would deal with it with
      peculiar partiality; the more so, as he had so distinguished a performer
      to work for.<a href="#linknote-280057" name="linknoteref-280057"
      id="linknoteref-280057"> 57 </a> The brilliant qualities of this splendid
      instrument are in point of fact thrown into the strongest relief. The
      contrasts of tone-colouring are made use of in every sort of way,
      especially in the low notes, here much employed in the accompaniment
      passages, whose wonderful effect Mozart was, as far as I know, the first
      to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p340.png">[340]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The capacity of the clarinet for melodious expression, tunefulness, and
      brilliant fluency, and for the union of force with melting tenderness, is
      skilfully taken into account; and as Mozart invariably brings the external
      into harmony with the internal, we find in this work that the grander and
      broader forms and the greater execution are the natural outcome of
      brilliant and original ideas. It is not too much to say that this concerto
      is the basis of modern clarinet-playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart composed on September 29, 1789, for the same fickle friend, the
      "Stadlersquintett" for clarinet and strings (582 K.), which was first
      performed at the concert for the Musicians' Charitable Fund on December
      22, 1789.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinct and frequently overpowering effect of the clarinet, in
      conjunction with stringed instruments, would necessitate its treatment as
      a solo instrument; and Mozart's loving efforts to display to the full its
      singular beauties and rich powers serve to isolate it still more
      completely. Although he avoids with equal taste and skill the danger of
      treating the stringed instruments as mere accompaniment, or of emphasising
      the clarinet unduly, and combines them to a whole often with touches of
      surprising delicacy, yet the heterogeneous elements are not so completely
      incorporated as are the stringed instruments when they are alone. The
      whole mechanism is therefore loose and easy, the subjects are more
      graceful than important, and their development less serious and profound
      than usual. This quintet therefore, cast as it is in the most beautiful
      forms, and possessed of the most charming sound effects&mdash;fully
      justifying the praise bestowed upon it by Ambros ("Limits of Music and
      Poetry") in Goethe's words, "its whole being floats in sensuous wealth and
      sweetness"&mdash;yet falls below the high level of the stringed quintets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Andante in A major to a violin concerto, dated in the Thematic
      Catalogue April 1, 1785 (470 K.), must certainly have been written for a
      virtuoso; perhaps for Janiewicz, who was then in Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart sometimes bestowed improvised compositions in the form of alms. One
      day a beggar accosted him in the <span class="side">MOZART'S CRITICISM ON
      FELLOW-ARTISTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p341.png">[341]</a></span>
      street and claimed a distant relationship with him. Mozart, having no
      money, went into the nearest coffee-house, wrote a minuet and trio, and
      sent the beggar with it to his publisher, who paid him what it was
      considered worth.<a href="#linknote-280058" name="linknoteref-280058"
      id="linknoteref-280058"> 58 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His ever-ready good-nature must have made Mozart a great favourite among
      his fellow-artists, and yet he had only too often to complain of the
      ingratitude to which his very good-nature subjected him. Between him and
      the majority of Italian opera-singers there existed, nevertheless, an
      innate antagonism; they complained of his compositions as being far too
      difficult and not telling enough. There can be no doubt that he made many
      concessions to display of execution, but these were not considered
      extensive enough at the time, and Mozart, scorning so cheap and easy a way
      of gaining the applause of the public, sought to attain his end by other
      and better means.<a href="#linknote-280059" name="linknoteref-280059"
      id="linknoteref-280059"> 59 </a> It is not to be wondered at, therefore,
      that the Italians in Vienna for the most part objected to singing in
      Mozart's operas, the more so as their disinclination was fostered by
      outsiders; Mozart, on his part, disliked the then prevalent style of
      singing: "They rush at it, and shake and make flourishes," he said,
      "because they have not studied, and cannot sustain a note."<a
      href="#linknote-280060" name="linknoteref-280060" id="linknoteref-280060">
      60 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fond of mocking in his sarcastic style at this kind of composition
      and performance, and used to imitate off-hand at the piano grand operatic
      scenas in the style of well-known masters, with the most telling effect.<a
      href="#linknote-280061" name="linknoteref-280061" id="linknoteref-280061">
      61 </a> Such exhibitions would not tend to increase the number of his
      friends. Mozart was "cutting" (<i>schlimm</i>), as we know, and took no
      pains to restrain his jesting moods, which were doubtless often taken in
      far worse part than they were meant. But he also pronounced many a sharp
      censure in earnest upon artists who felt the more bitter as his own <span
      class="side">MOZART'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p342.png">[342]</a></span> superiority made itself
      incontestably felt.<a href="#linknote-280062" name="linknoteref-280062"
      id="linknoteref-280062"> 62 </a> Soon after his settlement in Vienna his
      father was informed that his boasting and criticisms were making him
      enemies among musicians and others, but this accusation Wolfgang
      indignantly repelled (July 31, 1782).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, we find him writing not long afterwards (December 23, 1782):
      "I should like to write a book&mdash;a short musical criticism with
      examples; but of course not in my own name." There was a rage at Vienna
      for the discussion and criticism of all imaginable subjects by means of
      pamphlets and brochures.<a href="#linknote-280063"
      name="linknoteref-280063" id="linknoteref-280063"> 63 </a> That which
      tempted Mozart to take pen in hand was the downfall of German opera, which
      was a serious blow to him. He was conscious of what he as a German might
      have accomplished for German art, and it pained him to see the universal
      preference for Italian art and artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      From early youth he had been aware of the unworthy devices often employed
      in Italian music, and his aversion to "all Italians" continually betrays
      itself, but very seldom to the extent of making him unjust towards
      individual persons or performances. His healthy judgment and inexhaustible
      flow of human kindness preserved him from this danger. Jos. Frank relates<a
      href="#linknote-280064" name="linknoteref-280064" id="linknoteref-280064">
      64 </a> that, finding Mozart continually engaged on the study of French
      opera scores, he once asked him if he would not do better to devote
      himself to Italian music, which was then the fashion of the day in Vienna.
      Mozart answered: "As regards the melodies, yes; but as regards the
      dramatic effects, no; besides which, the scores that you <span class="side">CRITICISM

      65 </a> This was true, and we may allow that Mozart did not require to
      learn melody from the Italians. His judgments of various composers might
      offend at the time, but we are now ready to endorse them as not only
      striking but fair. We have already learnt his opinion of Righini (Vol.
      II., p. 251). Of Martin, the universal favourite, he said: "Much in his
      works is really very pretty, but ten years hence he will be quite
      forgotten."<a href="#linknote-280066" name="linknoteref-280066"
      id="linknoteref-280066"> 66 </a> How ready he was to acknowledge merit in
      any performance "which had something in it" is plainly shown in a letter
      to his father (April 24,1784):&mdash;

    <p>
      Some quartets have just appeared by a man named Pleyel; he is a pupil of
      Jos. Haydn. If you do not already know them, try to get them, it is worth
      your while. They are very well and pleasantly written, and give evidence
      of his master. Well and happy will it be for music if Pleyel is ready in
      due time to take Haydn's place for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just at the time when he was busy with his own quartets, where he
      showed how one master learns from another. When he found nothing original
      in any work he put it aside with the words, "Nothing in it," or vented his
      mocking humour on it. Rochlitz relates that once at Doles, he made them
      sing the Mass of a composer "who had evident talent for comic opera, but
      was out of place as a composer of sacred music," parodying the words in a
      very entertaining manner.<a href="#linknote-280067"

      The description which Mozart gives to his father of the celebrated oboist,
      J. Chr. Fischer (1733-1800), is characteristic of his sharp and
      involuntarily comic criticism. Fischer had come to Vienna from London,
      where he enjoyed an extraordinary reputation (April 4, 1787):<a
      href="#linknote-280068" name="linknoteref-280068" id="linknoteref-280068">

    </p>
    <p>
      If the oboist Fischer did not play better when we heard him in Holland
      (1766) than he plays now, he certainly does not deserve the reputation
      which he has. But, between ourselves, I was then at an age incapable of
      forming a judgment. I can only remember that he pleased me, as he pleased
      all the world. It would be quite reasonable to contend that taste has
      altered since then to a remarkable degree, and that he plays after the old
      school&mdash;but no! he plays, in fact, like a miserable learner; young
      AndrÃ©, who used to learn from Fiala, plays a thousand times better. And
      then his concertos of his own composition! Every ritornello lasts a
      quarter of an hour&mdash;then enter the hero&mdash;lifts up one leaden
      foot after another, and plumps them down on the ground alternately. His
      tone is all through his nose, and his tenuto is like the tremulant stop on
      the organ. Could you have supposed all this? and yet it is nothing but the
      truth, the real truth, which I tell you.

    <p>
      Mozart's amiability and good-nature prevailed in his personal intercourse
      with fellow-artists, even where reserve or irritated feeling would have
      been excusable. When the Italian Opera was reopened, from which Mozart had
      been purposely excluded, he did not withdraw his friendship from the
      composers, whom he might justifiably have considered as interlopers. When
      Paesiello came to Vienna from St. Petersburg in 1784 he was treated with a
      distinction never bestowed upon German masters. His "Barbiere di Seviglia"
      was at once put upon the stage, and the Emperor lost no time in
      commissioning him to compose an opera, for which Casti, as the most
      distinguished comic poet, was to provide the libretto. The opera was "Il
      Re Teodoro," for which Joseph himself suggested the subject as a satire,
      it was said, on the visit of Gustavus III. of Sweden to Venice in the year
      1783.<a href="#linknote-280069" name="linknoteref-280069"
      id="linknoteref-280069"> 69 </a> Such active participation from the
      Emperor assured the maestro a brilliant position, both pecuniary and
      social, during his stay in Vienna. Mozart, whose judgment of Paesiello's
      light music was very favourable,<a href="#linknote-280070"
      name="linknoteref-280070" id="linknoteref-280070"> 70 </a> made friendly

      II., p. 279) how pleased Mozart was to have his compositions performed
      before Paesiello by a talented pupil. Paesiello, on his part, begged for
      the score of "Idomeneo" for his own study.<a href="#linknote-280072"
      name="linknoteref-280072" id="linknoteref-280072"> 72 </a> Mozart was
      equally complaisant to Sarti, who was in Vienna at the same time, on his
      way to St. Petersburg. "If Maestro Sarti had not been obliged to set out
      to-day for Russia," he writes to his father (June 9, 1784), "he would have
      gone out with me. Sarti is a straightforward, honest man. I have played a
      great deal to him, ending with variations on one of his airs (460 K.),<a
      href="#linknote-280073" name="linknoteref-280073" id="linknoteref-280073">
      73 </a> which gave him great pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "honest" man afterwards wrote a most malicious criticism on some
      passages in Mozart's quartets, concerning which, indignant that
      "barbarians, without any sense of hearing should presume to think they can
      compose music," he exclaims, "Can more be done to put performers out of
      tune?" ("Si puÃ¶ far di piÃ¹ per far stonar i professori?"). He points out
      error after error "which could only be made by a clavier-player, who can
      see no difference between D sharp and E flat"; and concludes with a
      flourish, "This is, in the words of the immortal Rousseau, 'De la musique
      pour faire boucher ses oreilles!'"<a href="#linknote-280074"

      A charming instance of Mozart's benevolence towards younger artists is
      supplied by Gyrowetz. He relates in his autobiography, how he was
      introduced to the most distinguished artists of Vienna, at some grand
      soirÃ©e:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart appeared to be the most good-natured of them all. He observed the
      youthful Gyrowetz with an expression of sympathy which seemed to say:
      "Poor young fellow, you have just embarked on the ocean of the great
      world, and you are anxiously looking forward to what fate may have in
      store for you." Encouraged by so much affability and sympathy the young
      artist entreated the master to cast a glance over his compositions, which
      consisted of six symphonies, and to give his <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p346.png">[346]</a></span> opinion of them. With true
      benevolence, Mozart granted the petition, went through the works,
      commended them, and promised the young artist to have one of his
      symphonies performed at his concert in the hall at the Mehlgrube, where
      Mozart gave subscription concerts during that year (1785). This took place
      on a Thursday. The symphony was performed with great applause. Mozart,
      with his native courtesy and kindness, took the young composer by the
      hand, and introduced him to the public as the author of the symphonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beethoven made his appearance in Vienna as a youthful musician of promise
      in the spring of 1787, but was only able to remain there a short time;<a
      href="#linknote-280075" name="linknoteref-280075" id="linknoteref-280075">
      75 </a> he was introduced to Mozart, and played to him at his request.
      Mozart, considering the piece he performed to be a studied show-piece, was
      somewhat cold in his expressions of admiration. Beethoven remarking this,
      begged for a theme for improvisation, and, inspired by the presence of the
      master he reverenced so highly, played in such a manner as gradually to
      engross Mozart's whole attention; turning quietly to the bystanders, he
      said emphatically, "Mark that young man; he will make himself a name in
      the world!"<a href="#linknote-280076" name="linknoteref-280076"
      id="linknoteref-280076"> 76 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart does not appear to have become intimately acquainted with
      Dittersdorf, who at that time was paying only passing visits to Vienna;
      but his way of mentioning Mozart shows appreciation and esteem. The same
      may be said of Gluck, who, as we have seen, showed himself on several
      occasions well disposed towards Mozart (Vol. II., pp. 212, 285); but the
      difference of their natures&mdash;perhaps also Salieri's close connection
      with Gluck&mdash;prevented anything like intimacy between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, notwithstanding so much goodwill, Mozart should <span class="side">KOZELÃœCH.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p347.png">[347]</a></span> have
      met with envious critics and detractors<a href="#linknote-280077"
      name="linknoteref-280077" id="linknoteref-280077"> 77 </a> among the
      artists of Vienna is scarcely to be wondered at. We have already noticed
      one of his most determined opponents, Kreibich (Vol. II., p. 203);
      another, equally implacable, was Leopold Kozeluch, a pianist of some
      brilliancy, and a fashionable teacher, especially after he gave lessons at
      court; he had a passing reputation, too, as a composer, but vanity and
      stupidity were his chief claims to distinction. He was fond of magnifying
      his own merits by paltry criticism of his fellow-artists, especially of
      Haydn. Once, when a new quartet of Haydn's was being performed in a large
      company, Kozeluch, standing by Mozart, found fault, first with one thing
      and then with another, exclaiming at length, with impudent assurance, "I
      should never have done it in that way!" "Nor should I," answered Mozart;
      "but do you know why? Because neither you nor I would have had so good an
      idea."<a href="#linknote-280078" name="linknoteref-280078"
      id="linknoteref-280078"> 78 </a> Henceforth Kozeluch became Mozart's
      avowed and determined opponent; and what better revenge could be taken by
      the man "who never praised any one but himself," than to pronounce the
      overture to "Don Giovanni" "good, but full of faults";<a
      href="#linknote-280079" name="linknoteref-280079" id="linknoteref-280079">
      79 </a> and to exclaim condescendingly, after hearing the full rehearsal
      of the overture to the "ZauberflÃ¶te," "Ah, our good friend Mozart is
      trying to be learned this time!,,<a href="#linknote-280080"
      name="linknoteref-280080" id="linknoteref-280080"> 80 </a> When they were
      both at Prague, at the coronation of Leopold, Kozeluch expressed his
      enmity to Mozart so obtrusively, that he forfeited a great share of the
      interest "with which hitherto every Bohemian had been proud to own him as
      a fellow-countryman."<a href="#linknote-280081" name="linknoteref-280081"

      The most charming instance of Mozart's reverence and love for Joseph Haydn
      is the dedicatory epistle wherein he offers him his six quartets as the
      fruit of long and painful study inspired by his example, as a father
      intrusts his children to a tried and valued friend, confident of his
      protection and indulgence towards them. These expressions of reverence
      came from the very depths of Mozart's heart: to a friend who made some
      remark on the dedication he answered: "It was due from me, for it was from
      Haydn that I learned how quartets should be written."<a
      href="#linknote-280082" name="linknoteref-280082" id="linknoteref-280082">
      82 </a> "It was quite affecting," says Niemetschek" (p. 94) "to hear him
      speak of the two Haydns or any other of the great masters; one would have
      imagined him to be one of their enthusiastic pupils rather than the
      all-powerful Mozart." The Haydn so honoured of Mozart was not by any means
      the "Father Haydn" of a later time, reverenced and loved by all. It was
      not until after his residence in London that Haydn met with general
      admiration and veneration in the Austrian capital; in earlier years the
      opposition to his originality was nowhere stronger than in Vienna. His
      very position in the service of Prince Esterhazy, and his residence in
      Hungary, prejudiced the musicians of the capital against him. The
      music-loving public enjoyed his fresh and jovial creations with
      unrestrained delight, but the artists and connoisseurs took grave
      exception to them. Humour in music was as yet unrecognised, and the
      dispute as to whether and in what degree it could be justified had just
      begun; the freedom, well considered as it was, with which Haydn treated
      traditional rules, was looked upon as a grave fault. At the head of his
      opponents stood the Emperor Joseph;<a href="#linknote-280083"
      name="linknoteref-280083" id="linknoteref-280083"> 83 </a> he would have
      nothing to say to his playful oddities, and we can scarcely wonder that
      the royal example was widely followed, and that Haydn had good cause to
      complain of his critics and enemies.<a href="#linknote-280084"
      name="linknoteref-280084" id="linknoteref-280084"> 84 </a> It required
      <span class="side">HAYDN AND MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p349.png">[349]</a></span> an artist as genial and as
      incapable of envy as Mozart fully to understand and appreciate him. And
      Haydn was equally prompt to discover the greatness of Mozart, and to
      accord him his full share of admiration and esteem. We have seen the
      testimony which he bore of Mozart to his father (Vol. II., p. 321); and he
      lost no opportunity of expressing his conviction of Mozart's artistic
      greatness.<a href="#linknote-280085" name="linknoteref-280085"
      id="linknoteref-280085"> 85 </a> When it was proposed to produce an opera
      by Haydn at Prague, together with Mozart's "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni,"
      Haydn wrote to the Commissary Roth:<a href="#linknote-280086"
      name="linknoteref-280086" id="linknoteref-280086"> 86 </a>&mdash;

      You wish an opera buffa from me. With all my heart, if it will give you
      any pleasure to possess some of my vocal compositions. But if it is your
      intention to place the opera on the stage in Prague I am sorry that I
      cannot oblige you. My operas are inseparable from the company for whom I
      wrote them, and would never produce their calculated effect apart from
      their native surroundings. It would be quite another matter if I had the
      honour of being commissioned to write a new opera for the theatre in
      question. Even then, however, it would be a risk to put myself in
      competition with the great Mozart. If I could only inspire every lover of
      music, especially among the great, with feelings as deep, and
      comprehension as clear as my own, in listening to the inimitable works of
      Mozart, then surely the nations would contend for the possession of such a
      jewel within their borders. Prague must strive to retain the treasure
      within her grasp&mdash;but not without fitting reward. The want of this
      too often saddens the life of a great genius, and offers small
      encouragement for further efforts in future times. I feel indignant that
      Mozart has not yet been engaged at any imperial or royal court. Pardon my
      wandering from the subject&mdash;Mozart is a man very dear to me.

    <p>
      This letter was written in December, 1787, and the news of Mozart's
      appointment as Imperial private composer had not yet reached Haydn in
      Esterhaz; the uncertain position of his friend evidently affected him
      greatly. In the year following, when controversy was rife in Vienna on the
      subject of "Don Giovanni," Haydn found himself one evening in the midst of
      a company discussing the faults of omission <span class="side">MOZART'S
      FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p350.png">[350]</a></span> and commission of the new opera;
      at last he was asked for his opinion. "I cannot decide the questions in
      dispute," said he; "but this I know, that Mozart is the greatest composer
      in the world."<a href="#linknote-280087" name="linknoteref-280087"
      id="linknoteref-280087"> 87 </a> It must not be imagined that because
      Haydn set so high a value on Mozart's operatic compositions, he had by any
      means a small opinion of his own. Forgotten as they now are, he himself
      was not inclined to rank them below the performances of the majority of
      his contemporaries. He writes to Artaria (May 27, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mons. Le Gros, directeur of the Concert spirituel, writes me many
      compliments on my "Stabat Mater," which has been performed four times with
      great success. The management were surprised at this revelation of my
      powers as a vocal composer; but they had had no previous opportunity of
      judging of them. If they would only hear my operetta "L'Isola Disabitata,"
      and my last opera "La FedeltÃ¤ Premiata"! I assure you, such works have
      never yet been heard in Paris, and perhaps not in Vienna; but it is my
      misfortune to live retired in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says of the "Armida," in March, 1874, that it has been produced with
      signal success, and is considered his best work.<a href="#linknote-280088"
      name="linknoteref-280088" id="linknoteref-280088"> 88 </a> It is doubly
      significant, therefore, that Haydn should have acknowledged himself so
      completely overshadowed by Mozart as an operatic composer. And not in this
      branch of their art alone did he accord him superiority; he gave way even
      where they might justly be considered as rivals, and declared that, if
      Mozart had written nothing but his violin quartets and the "Requiem," he
      would have sufficient claim to immortality.<a href="#linknote-280089"
      name="linknoteref-280089" id="linknoteref-280089"> 89 </a> He assured a
      friend, with tears in his eyes, that he could never forget Mozart's

      name="linknoteref-280090" id="linknoteref-280090"> 90 </a> To the end of
      his life he missed no occasion of hearing Mozart's music, and used to
      assert that he had never heard one of his compositions without learning
      something from it.<a href="#linknote-280091" name="linknoteref-280091"

      The personal intercourse between the two was simple and hearty. Mozart
      used to call Haydn "Papa," and both Sophie Haibl and Griesinger mention
      their use of the pronoun <i>du</i> to each other, a habit less frequent in
      those days than at present between friends of such difference in age. But
      while Mozart lived in Vienna, Haydn had his fixed residence at Eisenstadt
      or Esterhaz, and only came to Vienna for a few months at a time with his
      princely patron, who was not fond of the capital, and shortened his stay
      there as far as was practicable; Haydn sometimes obtained leave of absence
      for a flying visit to Vienna, but the Prince always gave it unwillingly.<a
      href="#linknote-280093" name="linknoteref-280093" id="linknoteref-280093">

    <p>
      It was not until the Kapelle was broken up, on the death of Prince
      Nicolaus in 1790, that Haydn took up his abode in Vienna; and in December
      of the same year Salomon persuaded him to undertake the journey to London.
      Mozart agreed with others of Haydn's friends in considering this
      expedition a great risk, and drew his attention to the difficulties he was
      sure to encounter as an elderly man, unused to the world, amidst a strange
      people whose language he did not understand. Haydn replied that he was
      old, certainly, (he was then fifty-nine), but strong and of good courage,
      and his language was understood by all the world.<a href="#linknote-280094"
      name="linknoteref-280094" id="linknoteref-280094"> 94 </a> Mozart spent
      the day of Haydn's departure with him, and as they took leave he was moved
      to tears and exclaimed: "We are taking our last farewell in this world!"
      Haydn himself was deeply moved, thinking of his own death, and sought to
      console and calm Mozart.<a href="#linknote-280095"

      A letter from Haydn to Frau von Gennzinger (October 13, 1791) shows that
      calumniators sought to sow enmity between the friends in their separation:

      The sight of these two great and noble men extending to each other the
      hand of brotherhood, and remaining true to the end, untouched by
      professional envy or intrigue, is as pleasant as it was rare in the Vienna
      of those days. Each understood and appreciated the other, each freely
      acknowledged his indebtedness to the other from a musical point of view,
      and each, in his own consciousness of power and independence, found the
      standard for estimating the worth of his brother-artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who strove to raise the dust of dissension between them are, for the
      most part, forgotten or relegated to their due position in the background
      of musical history: Mozart and Haydn stand side by side on the heights,
      witnessing for ever to the truth that the greatness of a genuinely
      artistic nature attracts and does not repel its like.

      intercourse with whom Mozart found
      entertainment and refreshment of the highest kind, must be named the
      Countess Thun, <i>nÃ©e</i> Uhlefeld. She was one of the musical ladies who
      took him under their protection from the first, and it was she more
      especially who introduced him in Vienna, and furthered his advancement by
      every means in her power. The prominent position which was hers more in
      virtue of her cultivation and amiability than of her rank and wealth,
      pointed her out as <span class="side">COUNTESS THUN.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p353.png">[353]</a></span> a fitting
      protectress for genius. She was one of the few ladies with whom the
      Emperor Joseph continued in later years on a footing of intimacy, and he
      took leave of her in a touching letter from his death-bed.<a
      href="#linknote-29001" name="linknoteref-29001" id="linknoteref-29001"> 1
      </a> Music had the place of honour in her entertainments. She played the
      pianoforte herself with "that grace, lightness, and <i>dÃ©licatesse</i> to
      which no fingers but a woman's can aspire," as Burney says;<a
      href="#linknote-29002" name="linknoteref-29002" id="linknoteref-29002"> 2
      </a> he was delighted with her gay, natural manners, her witty sallies,
      and her pleasant irony, as well as with her taste, knowledge, and serious
      interest in all things musical.<a href="#linknote-29003"
      name="linknoteref-29003" id="linknoteref-29003"> 3 </a> Her favourite
      composer at that time (1772) was BeeckÃ© (Vol. I., p. 367), who mentions to
      Dalberg having composed in 1785 a sonata for three pianofortes for the
      Countess Thun and her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reichardt also, whom she took under her protection on his arrival in
      Vienna in 1783, extols her as the most intellectual and most charming
      woman in Vienna, and adds that her musical receptions were frequented both
      by the Emperor and the Archduke Maximilian.<a href="#linknote-29004"
      name="linknoteref-29004" id="linknoteref-29004"> 4 </a> Georg Forster
      became her enthusiastic admirer during his stay in Vienna in, 1784. He
      enumerates in a letter to Heyne<a href="#linknote-29005"
      name="linknoteref-29005" id="linknoteref-29005"> 5 </a> the distinguished
      men whose favour and patronage he enjoyed, and we recognise among them
      many of Mozart's friends and patrons. Such were the good old Counsellor
      von Born, Baron Otto von Gemmingen&mdash;the intimate friend of Van
      Swieten, who had come to Vienna in the summer of 1782<a
      href="#linknote-29006" name="linknoteref-29006" id="linknoteref-29006"> 6
      </a>&mdash;the old Councillor von Spielmann<a href="#linknote-29007"
      name="linknoteref-29007" id="linknoteref-29007"> 7 </a>&mdash;a man of
      learning and at the same time <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p354.png">[354]</a></span> more
      deeply versed in the affairs of the department of Prince Kaunitz than any
      other statesman&mdash;the great minister Kaunitz himself (Vol. II., p.
      212), good, simple Count Cobenzl (Vol. II., p. 173), Field-Marshal Haddik,
      "a splendid old soldier, plain and plump,"<a href="#linknote-29008"
      name="linknoteref-29008" id="linknoteref-29008"> 8 </a> and to this list
      Forster adds the name of the Countess Thun, "the most virtuous and
      enlightened woman of Vienna." He gives a more particular account of his
      intercourse with her to ThÃ©rÃ¨se Heyne:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot imagine how condescending and friendly every one is. One
      scarcely remembers that one is among persons of high rank, and one feels
      quite on the footing of an intimate friend. This is especially my case
      with the Countess Thun, the most charming woman in the world, and her
      three graces of daughters, each of them an angel in her own way. The
      Countess is the best mother that I know; the children are all innocence,
      joyful as the morning light, and full of natural sense and wit, at which I
      wonder in silence, just as I wonder at the sense and wit of a certain maid
      on the Leine. This charming family combine the most refined discourse, and
      the most extensive reading and liberal knowledge, with a pure, heartfelt
      religion, free from all superstition, the religion of gentle and innocent
      hearts familiar with the secrets of nature and creation. Almost every
      evening between nine and ten, these [above-named] people assemble at the
      Countess Thun's, and enjoy brilliant conversation or music, either
      clavier-playing, or German or Italian singing; sometimes, when the humour
      seizes them, they dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can well imagine how completely Mozart felt himself at home in this
      circle; Prince Karl Lichnowsky, his friend and pupil, was the Countess
      Thun's son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greiner's house was another in which learning was honoured and cherished,
      and which formed a meeting-point for all celebrities. Greiner's daughter,
      Caroline Pichler, an admirable pianiste,<a href="#linknote-29009"
      name="linknoteref-29009" id="linknoteref-29009"> 9 </a> thus describes it:<a
      href="#linknote-290010" name="linknoteref-290010" id="linknoteref-290010">
      10 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the poets Denis, Leon, Haschka, Alxinger, Blumauer, &amp;c., whose
      names were then famous, our house was frequented by men of severer
      science. No foreign scholar or artist visited Vienna without bringing
      introductions to Haschka or to my parents themselves. Thus we entertained
      the celebrated traveller Georg Forster, Professors Meiners and Spittler,
      Becker, GÃ¶gking, the actor Schroder, and many <span class="side">MARIANNE
      MARTINEZ.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p355.png">[355]</a></span>
      musicians and composers such as Paesiello and Cimarosa; I need not say
      that our native artists, Mozart, Haydn, Salieri, the brothers Hickl,
      FÃ¼ger, and others were frequent guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of the Martinez brother and sister, which has become by
      association a true temple of the muses for the Viennese, was another
      rendezvous for musicians, Metastasio, on his arrival at Vienna in 1730,
      took up his residence with Nicolai Martinez, Master of the Ceremonies to
      the Apostolic Nuncio, and remained with him until his death in 1782. He
      became the intimate friend of the family, and carefully superintended the
      education of the children. One of the daughters, Marianne (born about
      1740), by reason of her talent, and her lively, pleasant manners,
      attracted his special attention.<a href="#linknote-290011"
      name="linknoteref-290011" id="linknoteref-290011"> 11 </a> Through his
      instruction she became well versed in the Italian, French, and English
      languages and literature, and in all the branches of a liberal education.
      Nor was this all; Metastasio perceived that she possessed considerable
      musical talent, and took care that she should receive a thorough musical
      education. Joseph Haydn, who, on being dismissed from the Kapellhaus a
      penniless young man, had taken a miserable garret in the same house, was
      engaged to give Marianne lessons in playing and singing, for which he was
      boarded free for three years by way of payment,<a href="#linknote-290012"
      name="linknoteref-290012" id="linknoteref-290012"> 12 </a> a more
      important result for him being that he thus became acquainted with
      Porpora, who interested himself in Marianne's education out of friendship
      for Metastasio. Afterwards, under the careful guidance of Bono and of
      Metastasio himself, she developed gifts as a singer, player, and composer
      which excited general admiration,<a href="#linknote-290013"
      name="linknoteref-290013" id="linknoteref-290013"> 13 </a> and won
      applause from Hasse.<a href="#linknote-290014" name="linknoteref-290014"
      id="linknoteref-290014"> 14 </a> In 1773 she was made a member of the
      Philharmonic Academy at Bologna,<a href="#linknote-290015"
      name="linknoteref-290015" id="linknoteref-290015"> 15 </a> and afterwards
      received a "Dictor-diplom" both from Bologna and Pavia; in 1782 her
      oratorio "Isaaco" was performed at the "SocietÃ¤tsconcert."<a
      href="#linknote-290016" name="linknoteref-290016" id="linknoteref-290016">
      16 </a> She <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p356.png">[356]</a></span> lived with
      her brother (Imperial librarian) after the death of Metastasio, whose
      property she inherited;<a href="#linknote-290017" name="linknoteref-290017"
      id="linknoteref-290017"> 17 </a> she gave receptions, which were
      frequented by all the intellectual and musical celebrities of the day.<a
      href="#linknote-290018" name="linknoteref-290018" id="linknoteref-290018">
      18 </a> Kelly, who brought an introduction to her, declared that, in spite
      of her advanced age, she retained all the animation and cheerfulness of
      youth, and was pleasant and talkative. He says that Mozart (who had been
      warmly received by Metastasio on his early visits to Vienna) was very
      intimate with her, and that he had heard them play duets of her
      composition at her musical parties.<a href="#linknote-290019"
      name="linknoteref-290019" id="linknoteref-290019"> 19 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most distinguished musical dilettanti of the day at Vienna was
      the Geheimrath Bernh. von Keess (d. 1795). This "well-known lover of music
      and patron of musicians" took the amateur concerts in the Augarten (Vol.
      II., p. 284, note 47) under his protection, and possessed a rare and
      costly collection of musical objects.<a href="#linknote-290020"
      name="linknoteref-290020" id="linknoteref-290020"> 20 </a> He gave private
      concerts twice a week in his own house, as Gyrowetz relates:<a
      href="#linknote-290021" name="linknoteref-290021" id="linknoteref-290021">
      21 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The best virtuosi in Vienna, and the first composers, such as Jos. Haydn,
      Mozart, Dittersdorf, Hoffmeister, Albrechtsberger, Giamovichi, Ac.,
      assembled at these concerts. Haydn's symphonies were performed there,
      Mozart used generally to play the pianoforte, and Giamovichi, the most
      celebrated violin virtuoso of the day,<a href="#linknote-290022"
      name="linknoteref-290022" id="linknoteref-290022"> 22 </a> usually played
      a concerto; the lady of the house sang. It happened one evening that
      Mozart was late in arriving, and they waited for him to begin, because he
      had promised to bring with him a song for the lady of the house. One
      servant after another was sent to find him, and at last he was discovered
      in a tavern; the messenger begged him to come at once, as all the company
      was waiting to hear the new song. Mozart thereupon recollected that he had
      not written a note of it. He sent the messenger for a sheet of music
      paper, and set to work in the tavern to compose the song. When it was
      finished he went his way to the concert, where the company were waiting
      for him with great impatience. After a little gentle reproach for his
      delay he was most affectionately received; the lady of the house sang the
      new song, a little nervously, it is true, but it was enthusiastically
      received and applauded.

    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AS A VIRTUOSO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p357.png">[357]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's boyish fancy of only playing before connoisseurs naturally
      disappeared as he grew older and more sensible. He took pleasure in
      playing to all who took pleasure in hearing him, and was so far from the
      affectation of requiring to be pressed, that many persons of rank in
      Vienna reproached him with being too ready to play to anybody who asked
      him. One requirement, indeed, he made which seems difficult of attainment
      in musical society, viz., the silence and attention of his audience.
      "Nothing irritated him so much," says Niemetschek (p. 88), "as
      restlessness, noise, or talking over music. On such occasions the usually
      gentle, courteous man completely lost patience, and expressed his
      annoyance without reserve. He has been known to rise in the middle of his
      playing, and leave an inattentive audience." In some cases his satirical
      humour led him to show his disgust in other ways.<a href="#linknote-290023"
      name="linknoteref-290023" id="linknoteref-290023"> 23 </a> When he was
      playing to real musicians and connoisseurs he was indefatigable.<a
      href="#linknote-290024" name="linknoteref-290024" id="linknoteref-290024">
      24 </a> After his concert in Leipzig, where he had alternately played and
      conducted, he said to the good old violin-player Berger: "I have only just
      got warm. Come home with me, and I will play you something worthy of an
      artist's ears." And after a hasty supper, his ideas and imaginations
      streamed from the instrument till close on midnight. Then suddenly
      springing up, as his manner was, he cried: "Now, what do you think of
      that? You have heard Mozart after his own fashion; something less will do
      for the others."<a href="#linknote-290025" name="linknoteref-290025"
      id="linknoteref-290025"> 25 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The family with whom Mozart appeared most completely at home in Vienna was
      that of the celebrated botanist Freih. von Jacquin. We have an attractive
      description of it (1844) from Caroline Pichler, who was intimate there
      from her youth:<a href="#linknote-290026" name="linknoteref-290026"
      id="linknoteref-290026"> 26 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      This family had for sixty or seventy years been a shining light in the
      scientific world, both in and out of Vienna, and their house was visited
      by many for the sake of the pleasant social intercourse there to be
      enjoyed. While the learned, or would-be learned, paid their respects to
      <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p358.png">[358]</a></span> the famous father and his worthy
      son, Jos. Frz. v. Jacquin,<a href="#linknote-290027"
      name="linknoteref-290027" id="linknoteref-290027"> 27 </a> the more
      youthful assembled round the younger son Gottfried, whose lively
      intellect, striking talent for music, and charming voice made him the
      centre of the gay circle, together with his sister Franziska, the
      still-surviving Frau von Lagusius. On Wednesday evenings&mdash;which from
      time immemorial, were dedicated by the family to society, even in winter
      when the Jacquins lived in the Botanic Gardens<a href="#linknote-290028"
      name="linknoteref-290028" id="linknoteref-290028"> 28 </a>&mdash;learned
      talk went on in the father's room, while we young people chattered, joked,
      made music, played games, and entertained ourselves entirely to our
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      How thoroughly happy and at home Mozart was with this family may be seen
      from a letter to Gottr. von Jacquin, written in the full glow of his
      happiness at the brilliant reception he had met with in Prague (January
      14,1787):<a href="#linknote-290029" name="linknoteref-290029"
      id="linknoteref-290029"> 29 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I am fortunate enough to find a moment in which to inquire after
      your dear parents, and all the Jacquin family. I can only hope and pray
      that you are all as well and happy as we two are. I can assure you,
      however, that (although we have been received here with extreme politeness
      and all possible honour, and Prague is really a handsome, pleasant city) I
      long very much for Vienna, and most particularly for <i>your</i> house.
      When I reflect that after my return I shall enjoy the pleasure of your
      society again for a short time, and then perhaps lose it for ever, I feel
      to its full extent the friendship and esteem which I bear to your whole
      family. Now farewell! Present my respects to your revered parents, and
      embrace your brother for me. I kiss your sister's hand a thousand times.
      But now it is time I close, is it not? Long ago, you will think. Write to
      me soon, very soon; if you are too lazy to do it yourself, send for
      Salmann, and dictate a letter to him; but it never comes straight from the
      heart unless you write yourself. Well&mdash;I shall see whether you are as
      much my friend as I am, and always shall be, yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his second stay in Prague Mozart acquaints his friend with the good
      reception of "Don Giovanni" (November 4, 1787),<a href="#linknote-290030"
      name="linknoteref-290030" id="linknoteref-290030"> 30 </a> and adds:&mdash;

      I wish that all my friends (especially Bridi and you) could be here just
      for one evening to participate in my pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he ends in his mocking way:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My great grandfather used to say to his wife, my great grandmother, and
      she to her daughter my grandmother, and she again to her daughter, my
      mother, and she finally to her daughter, my dear sister, that it was a
      great art to be able to speak well and fully, but that it was perhaps a
      still greater art to know when to leave off speaking. I will, therefore,
      now follow the advice of my sister due to our mother, grandmother, and
      great grandmother, and bring my moral reflections and my letter to a close
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when, to his "delighted surprise," he received a second letter from
      Jacquin, he answers in a postscript:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Can it be that neither your dear parents, nor your sisters and brother
      keep me in remembrance? That is incredible! I put it down to your
      forgetfulness, my friend, and I flatter myself that I may safely do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gius. Ant. Bridi, of whom Mozart speaks in the above letter, was a young
      merchant of Roveredo, who was a favourite in musical circles<a
      href="#linknote-290031" name="linknoteref-290031" id="linknoteref-290031">

      of their friendship exists in the song composed for Jacquin on March 23,
      1787: "Mentre di lascio, o figlia," from Paesiello's "Disfatta di Dario"
      (513 K., part 9). A comparison of this with the song composed <span
      class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p360.png">[360]</a></span> for Fischer shows how well
      Mozart understood the art of adapting himself to given conditions. There
      is no presupposition here of such a compass and flexibility of voice, nor
      of such force of passion as give the earlier song its original stamp; all
      that is required is a bass voice of moderate compass and no great depth, a
      certain volubility of voice, and a considerable amount of feeling and
      cultivation. The situation excludes any expression of violent emotion, and
      moderates the sentiment without rendering it less hearty; we are called on
      to sympathise with the sorrow of a father taking leave of his daughter at
      a moment pregnant with fate, not with that of a youth parting from his
      beloved. Here again external conditions have been utilised in the
      production of a song which is worthy by its beauty of form and grace of
      expression to take a high rank among others of its class.<a
      href="#linknote-290035" name="linknoteref-290035" id="linknoteref-290035">
      35 </a> Mozart composed other songs for his friend and his friend's
      family; ballads, for instance, for particular occasions and friends.
      Concerning one of these, he writes: "If the song <i>en question</i> is to
      be a test of my friendship, have no more doubt on the subject, here it is.
      But I hope that you do not need the song to convince you of my friendship"
      (Prague, November 4, 1787). Another, "Erzeugt von heisser Phantasie" (520
      K.) is inscribed: "Den 26 Mai, 1787, in Hrn. Gottfried von Jacquin's
      Zimmer, Landstrasse." Several charming little canzonetti for two sopranos
      and a bass, with Italian words, were also written for this circle, Mozart
      indicates one of them, "PiÃ¹ non si trovano" (549 K.), under date July 16,
      1788, and there are five other nottumi of the kind existing in autograph,
      viz.: "Luci cari luci belle" (346 K.); "Ecco quel fiero istante," by
      Metastasio (436 K.); "Mi lagnero tacendo," by Metastasio (437 K.); "Se
      lontan <span class="side">GOTTFR. V. JACQUIN AND MOZART.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p361.png">[361]</a></span> ben mio tu
      sei" (438 K.), "Due pupille amabili" (439 K.). To these exists in Mozart's
      handwriting wind-instrument accompaniment, for two clarinets and a
      basset-horn, or three basset-homs, a combination often employed by Mozart,
      apparently without any special reason. The accompaniment may be dispensed
      with, the canzonetti being properly intended for the voices alone. They
      are extremely simple, but full of grace and charm, and betray the master
      in their harmonic turns and disposition of parts. It may be inferred that
      these compositions were primarily intended for the Jacquin family, from
      the fact that several of them passed as the composition of Gottfr. von
      Jacquin in Vienna, as was the case with more than one solo song concerning
      whose authenticity there can be no doubt. Mozart set little store by such
      occasional compositions; they passed from hand to hand, and as Jacquin
      himself composed songs, which were put in circulation from his house, some
      of Mozart's might easily, without any fault on his part, be ascribed to
      him. As a set-off to these, the bass song, "Io ti lascio, o cara, addio"
      (245 K. Anh.), composed by Jacquin, is to this day included among Mozart's
      works. In the "Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung," where it was first
      printed, it was expressly stated that the original was in Mozart's
      handwriting, and was written by him in a few minutes, as he took leave of
      a lady friend; the scene was afterwards variously laid at Prague and
      Mayence, and elaborated into a love episode. But in a letter to Hartel
      (May 25, 1799), Mozart's widow protested against the genuineness both of
      the song and of the story, and emphatically asserted, supported by the
      AbbÃ© Stadler, that the song was composed by Gottfr. von Jacquin as a
      farewell to the Countess Hatzfeld, and that Mozart put the accompaniment
      to it. The song contains Mozart-like phrases, but no characteristic
      touches of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly relates that he composed Metastasio's "Grazie agi' inganni tuoi,"
      that Mozart was pleased with the simple melody, and wrote variations upon
      it.<a href="#linknote-290036" name="linknoteref-290036"
      id="linknoteref-290036"> 36 </a> These do not exist, but we have a sketch
      by Mozart in which Kelly's melody, <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p362.png">[362]</a></span> with
      some slight improvements, and a new middle phrase, is arranged for two
      soprano voices and a bass, with a wind instrument accompaniment (flute,
      two clarinets, horns and bassoons) no doubt for some special occasion (532
      K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerted songs of this kind were then a favourite pastime in musical
      circles; they were often comic, and sometimes coarse. No one will doubt
      that Mozart was always ready for this species of fun, and his comic
      "Bandl-Terzett" (441 K.) was known, not only among his Vienna friends,<a
      href="#linknote-290037" name="linknoteref-290037" id="linknoteref-290037">
      37 </a> but far and wide among lovers of music and fun. Mozart had made
      his wife a present of a new belt ribbon which she wished to wear one day
      when she was going for a walk with Jacquin. Not finding it she called to
      her husband: "Liebes Mandl, wo ists Bandl?" (Where is the belt, my dear?)
      They both looked for it in vain till Jacquin joined them and found it. But
      he refused to give it up, held it high in the air, and being a very tall
      man, the Mozarts, both little, strove in vain to reach it. Entreaties,
      laughter, scolding, were all in vain, till at last the dog ran barking
      between Jacquin's legs. Then he gave up the ribbon, and declared that the
      scene would make a good comic terzet. Mozart took the hint, wrote the
      words in the Vienna dialect (which is essential for the comic effect), and
      sent the terzet to Jacquin.<a href="#linknote-290038"
      name="linknoteref-290038" id="linknoteref-290038"> 38 </a> Well sung, it
      never fails of its effect. A four-part pendant to the terzet "Caro mio
      Druck und Schluck," was in the possession of Mozart's widow, as she
      informed Hartel (May 25, 1799); it seems to have been a canon with a comic
      bass part (Anh. 5 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Canons were in special favour at the social gatherings of <span
      class="side">CANONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p363.png">[363]</a></span> which we have been speaking. It
      may always be taken for granted that children and persons of slight
      musical cultivation will take peculiar pleasure in this severest form of
      musical mechanism, if the persistent regularity with which each part
      pursues its independent course is combined with a general effect of
      harmony and satisfaction. For the enlightened few, the interest arises
      from such a skilful handling of forms confined within the strictest rules
      as shall emphasise epigrammatic points in the most vivid and telling
      manner. So in poetry, the sonnet, the triolet, and other similar forms
      serve by their very limitations to emphasise the conceits which they
      express. The same sort of contrast, produced without departing from a
      strict adherence to rule, forms the chief effect of the canon. The sharp
      definition of its various parts gives it abundance of means for
      accentuating particular points, aided by their constant recurrence in
      different positions and different lights. The canon, therefore, is the <i>epigrammatic</i>
      form of music, the most suitable vehicle for a moral sentence or a witty
      phrase, and it is capable of expressing alike the most serious and the
      most comic ideas. It requires, indeed, the firm hand of a master so to
      triumph over the difficulties of the form as to produce not only a
      masterpiece of counterpoint for the satisfaction of the learned, but also
      a melodious self-sufficing vocal piece, whose most studied difficulties
      shall leave the impression of lucky accidents. The greatest masters seem
      to have turned for recreation to the composition of canons,<a
      href="#linknote-290039" name="linknoteref-290039" id="linknoteref-290039">
      39 </a> and even grave men like Padre Martini<a href="#linknote-290040"

      id="linknoteref-290041"> 41 </a> did not disdain to write comic canons.
      Mozart cultivated the style, and a long list may be placed under his name.
      In the "Oeuvres" (XV., XVI.) two two-part, nine three-part, nine
      four-part, and one six-part <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p364.png">[364]</a></span> canons
      are printed; but they are certainly not all genuine. In the Thematic
      Catalogue, the following are noted as composed by Mozart:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>XV.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Difficile Iectu [Nimm ists gleich warm] three-part (559 K.).

      4. Gemma in Prater [AllÃ©s ist eitel], four-part (558 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Bona nox [Gute Nacht], four-part (561 K.).!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these there must have been four more published from Mozart's
      autograph, for the widow writes (November 30, 1799) that she has sent
      thirteen canons in the original. But of these one (XV. 12) "O wunderschon"
      (227 K.) was by W. Byrd (d. 1623), published by Mattheson (Vollk. Kapellm.
      p. 409), and only copied by Mozart, and the same may have been the case
      with others. We recognise Mozart with some certainty in:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>XVI.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. L. m. d. A. r. s. [Nichts labt. mich mehr.], four-part (233 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Lieber Freistadler, lieber Gaulimauli [Wer nicht liebt], four-part (232
      K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      7. L. m. i. A. [Lasst uns froh sein], six-part (231 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      9. [Lass immer] two-part (410 K.). But this canon exists in Mozart's
      handwriting as an adagio for two basset-homs with a bassoon, perhaps as an
      accompaniment to a vocal piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the others I can speak with no certainty; but those which are
      well authenticated seem to me by far the finest. Some genuine canons by
      Mozart are omitted from this collection, such as the four-part canon,
      called in the Thematic Catalogue "Nascoso" (557 K.), which is particularly
      fine.<a href="#linknote-290042" name="linknoteref-290042"
      id="linknoteref-290042"> 42 </a> There are serious canons,<a
      href="#linknote-290043" name="linknoteref-290043" id="linknoteref-290043">
      43 </a> cheerful canons,<a href="#linknote-290044"
      name="linknoteref-290044" id="linknoteref-290044"> 44 </a> and an
      overwhelming majority of comic canons. The words <span class="side">CANONS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p365.png">[365]</a></span> to
      these last were generally his own; they are almost always in the Vienna
      dialect, and not a few of them are too coarse for publication, although
      they are preserved in verbal tradition. The original words of two of the
      most authentic may serve as an example of the rest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grechtelseng, grechtelseng, wir gehn in Prater. In Prater? itzt, lass
      nach, i lass mi nit stimma. Ei bei Leib. Ei ja wohl. Mi bringst nit aussi!
      Was blauscht der? was blauscht der? Itzt halts Maul, i gieb dir a
      Tetschen! (556 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma in Proda, gemma in d' Hetz, gemma in Kasperl. Der Kasperl ist krank,
      der Bar ist verreckt, was that ma in der Hetz drausst, in Prater giebts
      Gelsen und Haufen von Dreck (558 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun consisted essentially in the dialogue form and colloquial
      expressions of the text&mdash;as will be evident to all who compare the
      newly substituted versions, which, unexceptionable and correct as they
      are, neutralise the whole comic effect&mdash;of the canons. Mozart's
      mastery of form and his wonderful power of transforming everything he
      attempted into a complete and well-rounded work of art, are displayed in
      all the canons without exception; each one contains the clear expression
      of a particular mood, together with a melodious beauty, so thoroughly
      consistent with the form in which they are embodied as to appear
      inseparable from it. Finding eight four-part and two three-part canons
      under one date (September 2, 1788) in the Thematic Catalogue, we may be
      inclined to imagine that Mozart was seized with a sort of periodical
      canon-fever; but it is more probable that some circumstance led to his
      noting on that day all the works of the kind that he had either in hand or
      in prospect. No doubt most of them were composed on the spur of the
      moment, as we know was the case with two among the list. The tenor singer,
      Joh. Nepomuk Peierl, "a man of refinement," according to Schroder,<a
      href="#linknote-290045" name="linknoteref-290045" id="linknoteref-290045">
      45 </a> who had sung with his wife for several years at the Salzburg
      theatre, paid a short visit to Vienna in 1785, and became acquainted with
      Mozart. He had a peculiar pronunciation which often made him the subject
      of raillery, and Mozart made it the <span class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p366.png">[366]</a></span> text
      for a three-part canon of wonderfully comic effect.<a
      href="#linknote-290046" name="linknoteref-290046" id="linknoteref-290046">
      46 </a> This was scarcely ended when the singers turned over the leaf, and
      began another four-part canon (560 K.) on the words: "O du eselhafter
      Peierl! o du peirlischer Esel! du bist so faul als wie ein Gaul, der weder
      Kopf noch Haxen hat, mit dir ist gar nichts anzufangen, ich seh dich noch
      am Galgen hangen; du dummer Gaul! du bist so faul! du dummer
    </p>
    <p>
      Peierl bist so faul als wie ein Gaul; O lieber Freundverzeihe mir!
      Nepomuk! Peierl! verzeihe mir!"<a href="#linknote-290047"
      name="linknoteref-290047" id="linknoteref-290047"> 47 </a> There is
      nothing particularly refined or amusing about the jest except the very
      excellent and effective canon. This was so highly applauded that it was
      employed on other occasions with more emphatic invectives, addressed to
      other individuals.<a href="#linknote-290048" name="linknoteref-290048"
      id="linknoteref-290048"> 48 </a> Mozart's marvellous gift of
      improvisation, showing itself in this form among others, is illustrated by
      an anecdote vouched for by Rochlitz. The evening before Mozart left
      Leipzig for Berlin, whence he intended to return in a few days, he supped
      with the Precentor Doles, with whom he was very intimate. His
      entertainers, melancholy at the prospect of parting, begged for a few
      lines of his writing by way of remembrance. Mozart was in a merry mood,
      laughed at their "whining," and declared he would rather go to bed than
      write music. At last he took a sheet of note-paper, tore it in half, sat
      down and wrote&mdash;at the most for five or six minutes. Then he handed
      one-half to the son, the other to the father. On one page was a three-part
      canon in long notes without words, and when sung very melancholy and
      melodious. On the second page was also a three-part canon without words,
      but in quavers, and full of drollery. When they had discovered <span
      class="side">THE MUSIKALISCHE SPASS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p367.png">[367]</a></span> that the two might be sung
      together, Mozart wrote to the first the words, "Lebet wohl, wir sehn uns
      wieder!" To the second, "Heult noch gar wie alte Weiber"&mdash;and so they
      were sung.<a href="#linknote-290049" name="linknoteref-290049"
      id="linknoteref-290049"> 49 </a> Unhappily this double canon is not
      preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many comic compositions of this kind are ascribed to Mozart wrongly or on
      insufficient grounds.<a href="#linknote-290050" name="linknoteref-290050"
      id="linknoteref-290050"> 50 </a> One most diverting example of his love of
      humour exists in the "Musikalische Spass," as he calls it himself&mdash;the
      "Bauem-symphonie," as it is sometimes designated&mdash;which was probably
      written for a special occasion on June 11, 1787; owing, no doubt, to
      pressure of time it was only partially scored. Ignorant composers and
      unskilful performers are ridiculed together in this piece, which is in the
      form of a divertimento (Vol. I., p. 303) in four movements for string
      quartet and two horns. The ridicule of the players is very broad, as, for
      instance, when the horns, where they should come in solo in the minuet,
      play actual wrong notes, or when the first violin at the close of a long
      cadenza, consisting of a number of trivial disconnected passages, finishes
      off with an ascending scale, and goes at least half a tone too high. But
      the most amazing confusion occurs at the end, where, in the midst of a
      fanfare in F major for the horns, the stringed instruments strike in one
      after another, each in a different key. A semitone higher or lower is
      treated as a matter of small importance, thirds are carried on even where
      they are out of place; but sometimes, when a part seems to come in too
      soon, or when nothing but accompaniment is heard for several bars, as if
      the principal parts were pausing too long, or when at a particular point a
      note occurs which sounds excruciatingly false, it is only by the context
      that we can be assured that no actual mistake has happened, and that the
      composer does not deserve to be hissed on his own <span class="side">SOCIAL
      INTERCOURSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p368.png">[368]</a></span>
      account. This is repeatedly the case also in the plan and treatment of the
      movements as a whole; they are after the usual pattern, turns and passages
      occur of the customary kind, with here and there a striking modulation,
      but there is a complete lack of power to grasp or carry out an idea; two
      or three bars bring each effort to an end, and there is a constant
      recurrence to the traditional formula of the closing cadence. The attempt
      after thematic elaboration in the finale is very ludicrous; it is as
      though the composer had heard of such a thing, and strove to imitate it in
      a few phrases, greatly to his own satisfaction. The art is most remarkable
      whereby the pretended ignorance never becomes wearisome, and the audience
      is kept in suspense throughout. The effect rests partly on the shrewd
      conception of what is truly comic in ignorant pretension (for nowhere is
      irony more dangerous than in music, the impression of discord being one
      difficult of control), partly on the perfect mastery of the instruments
      displayed by the composer.<a href="#linknote-290051"
      name="linknoteref-290051" id="linknoteref-290051"> 51 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the compositions resulting mainly at least from friendship or social
      circumstances may be included the songs or ballads (Lieder) of which we
      have already noticed some examples.<a href="#linknote-290052"
      name="linknoteref-290052" id="linknoteref-290052"> 52 </a> In Vienna and
      South Germany the "Lied" was far from having attained, at that time, the
      importance it afterwards possessed. Even in social circles, classical and,
      therefore so far as song was concerned, Italian music predominated, and
      aspiring dilettanti sought exclusively for songs which should display
      their artistic cultivation. Dilettantism was then just beginning to bear
      sway, especially over the pianoforte, and its dominion speedily extended
      to vocal music, where the "Lied" became its peculiar form of expression.
      In North Germany the state of affairs was somewhat different. Italian
      opera in Dresden and Berlin was too isolated to <span class="side">LIEDER.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p369.png">[369]</a></span> have
      much influence; the want of practised singers had caused the cultivation
      of the operetta, which fell back on the confined form and simple
      expression of the "Lied," and in its turn raised the "Lied," which had
      lingered only in taverns<a href="#linknote-290053"
      name="linknoteref-290053" id="linknoteref-290053"> 53 </a> and the
      domestic circle, to higher significance and cultivation. Weisse expressly
      declared that his operas were intended to incite the Germans to social
      song. Nor had earlier and greater composers, such as Telemann, Graun, Ph.
      Em. Bach, and others, disdained to compose ballads, or odes as they were
      then called, for domestic practice. In Berlin this tendency was especially
      active, and Marpurg, in his "Critical Letters," treats of the musical ode
      ("Chanson, Strophenlied") historically and aesthetically, and appends a
      long list of examples. The influence of the operetta upon the development
      of the 44 Lied" is unmistakable. It was something more than chance which
      caused the simultaneous rise of German lyric poetry in many parts of North
      Germany, which produced such lyric poets as Weisse, Uz, Gleim, Hagedom,
      Jacobi, &amp;c., and the "Dichterbund" of Gottingen, with Hiller as their
      special composer. Klopstock had little to do with the movement. His odes
      have found composers, especially (not to mention Reefe) Gluck, who
      followed his principles in keeping close to the words of the poet, and
      aiming at declamatory effect.<a href="#linknote-290054"
      name="linknoteref-290054" id="linknoteref-290054"> 54 </a> He was followed
      by Reichardt, a warm admirer of Klopstock,<a href="#linknote-290055"
      name="linknoteref-290055" id="linknoteref-290055"> 55 </a> who wrote an
      essay on the composition of Klopstock's odes.<a href="#linknote-290056"
      name="linknoteref-290056" id="linknoteref-290056"> 56 </a> But they had
      little influence, and the musical treatment of lyrical poetry received its
      chief impulse when Herder awoke the taste for national songs, and Goethe
      produced genuine German lyric poems: Reichardt<a href="#linknote-290057"
      name="linknoteref-290057" id="linknoteref-290057"> 57 </a> and Schulz<a
      href="#linknote-290058" name="linknoteref-290058" id="linknoteref-290058">
      58 </a> were the two composers who felt <span class="side">SOCIAL
      INTERCOURSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p370.png">[370]</a></span>
      this impulse most strongly, and mainly strove for the development of the
      German ballad in its own simple popular style.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this phase of musical influence had, in Mozart's day, hardly
      penetrated to Vienna. Hofmann, Steffan, BeeckÃ©, Haydn, and others had
      indeed composed Lieder, but they laid claim to nothing higher than the
      amusement of social circles; the words are generally of mediocre merit,
      and the music so simple as to make it evident that the song did not intend
      to intrude into good society. Mozart only occasionally composed Lieder.<a
      href="#linknote-290059" name="linknoteref-290059" id="linknoteref-290059">
      59 </a> He was in the habit, as his wife writes to Hartel, of writing down
      in a book kept for the purpose any poem which he admired, or which incited
      him to composition; but his reading was not extensive, and there was
      little to attract him in Vienna at that time. He had his own opinions on
      this subject as on others, and we are struck with his remarks in a letter
      to his father (December 23,1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am at work upon a very difficult matter, viz., the setting of an ode on
      Gibraltar, by Denis.<a href="#linknote-290060" name="linknoteref-290060"
      id="linknoteref-290060"> 60 </a> But it is a secret, for a Hungarian lady
      wishes to surprise Denis with it. The ode is dignified&mdash;fine, if you
      like&mdash;but too pompous and exaggerated for my taste. How can it be
      otherwise? Truth and moderation are hardly known and never valued
      nowadays. If a thing is to succeed it must either be so easy that a
      hackney-coach-man could imitate it, or so incomprehensible that, just
      because they do not understand it, everybody is ready to praise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every competent critic will endorse Mozart's opinion on Denis's ode;<a
      href="#linknote-290061" name="linknoteref-290061" id="linknoteref-290061">
      61 </a> but how many then in Vienna were as independent and candid in
      their judgment on the favourite poet as the young composer? A facsimile of
      Mozart's hasty sketch of part of this ode is taken from the archives of
      the Mozarteum at Salzburg. Whether the ode was ever finished I do not
      know.

      We may gather that Mozart's Lieder were the result of occasional impulses,
      from the fact that they occur at long intervals, and that he usually wrote
      several at one time. On May 7, 1785, he composed three poems by Weisse; on
      the autograph (472-474, K.) is noted, "Weisse, erster Band, p. 18,14,29";
      Weisse's lyrical poems (Leipzig, 1772) formed part of Mozart's modest
      library. The year 1787, however, was most fruitful, owing doubtless to his
      constant intercourse with Jacquin; we find four in May (517-520, K.), two
      on June 24 (523, 524, K.), two at Prague on November 6 (529, 530, K.), and
      another on December 11 (531 K.). Then there is a pause until January 14,
      1791, when three ballads (596-598, K.) were composed, according to Nissen,
      for a children's publication.<a href="#linknote-290062"
      name="linknoteref-290062" id="linknoteref-290062"> 62 </a> Mozart
      published but few of these compositions;<a href="#linknote-290063"
      name="linknoteref-290063" id="linknoteref-290063"> 63 </a> they generally
      remained in the possession of those for whom they were written, and were
      circulated in MS. copies, which explains why many were attributed to him
      which he never wrote, while some of his own composition were attributed to
      others.<a href="#linknote-290064" name="linknoteref-290064"
      id="linknoteref-290064"> 64 </a> The greater number of them <span
      class="side">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p372.png">[372]</a></span> are true "Strophenlieder," such
      as the ballads from Campe's "Kinderbibliothek" (595, 598, K.), to which
      also belongs the ballad for little Fritz's birthday (529 K.), to which
      very unsuitable words have been adapted. These are all manifestly easy and
      simple, and possess the same charm from the mouths of children as "Komm
      lieber Mai." Hagedom's little song, "Zu meiner Zeit bestand noch Recht und
      Bil-ligkeit" (517 K.), is jestingly treated; Mozart himself has written
      over it, "A little through the nose," to emphasise the proper comic
      delivery. The quality which distinguishes these songs from the majority of
      those contemporary with them is not so much their perfect form and finish,
      their attractive melodies, or their harmonious delicacy (though these
      exist in full measure) as their vivid expression of a poetic mood, be it
      cheerful, earnest, or passionate. The poems of Hagedorn, Weisse, Jacobi,
      Overbeck, HÃ¶lty, Miller, Claudius, and others whose names are unknown,
      seem to us little calculated to stir the poetical productivity of the
      composer; and the passionate expression and forcible accentuation of some
      of the songs strike us as being almost in opposition to the words of the
      poem. Look only at the close of the second song, "Zufriedenheit"
    </p>
    <p>
      (473 K.), "Und angenehm ist selbst mein Schmerz, wenn ich vor Liebe
      weine"; or the words in the "Betragenen Welt" (474 K.), "Eswird ein
      prachtig Fest vollzogen, bald hinkt die Reue hinterdrein." We must not
      leave out of account, however, that the standpoint of literary cultivation
      accepted by Mozart and his contemporaries had its own conceptions and
      standard of poetic representation;<a href="#linknote-290065"
      name="linknoteref-290065" id="linknoteref-290065"> 65 </a> a perhaps not
      very distant future will doubtless feel equal wonder at some of the poems
      set to music in our own day. It is more important to note Mozart's
      exposition of his own poetic nature, which led him to grasp and embody,
      not so much the words and the form, as the animating idea of the poem
      before him. Therefore <span class="side">LIEDER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p373.png">[373]</a></span> it is that he
      gives us in his music a depth and truth of emotion which are wanting in
      the words. Take, for example, the first song by Weisse, "Der Zauberer."
      Divest it of the pastoral costume, which is strange to us, and of the
      tame, somewhat clumsy expression, and retain the situation of a young girl
      awaking to her first consciousness of love with timid amazement. This we
      shall find in Mozart's composition; certainly not in Weisse's shepherdess.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one song of passionate and sorrowful expression&mdash;"Trennung und
      Wiedervereinigung," by Jacobi&mdash;two verses, in which the sentiment is
      considerably modified, have a fresh setting, and the first melody recurs
      only at the close. Others have each verse the same. One of these is the
      song "An ChloÃ«" (524 K.), perhaps the best known and liked of all Mozart's
      pleasant, easy melodies; but it is the least significant and song-like of
      any, being formed after the manner of Italian canzonetti.
      "Abendempfindung" (523 K.) is more original and finer in its expression of
      emotion and in its form, which appears to yield to its changing moods, but
      is in reality both finished and well defined; "UnglÃ¼ckliche Liebe" (520
      K.) is passionate and almost dramatic, a definite situation being
      indicated by the poet in the superscription: "Als Louise die Briefe ihres
      ungetreuen Liebhabers verbrannte."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crown of all the songs, by virtue of its touching expression of
      emotion and its charming perfection of form, is unquestionably Goethe's
      "Veilchen" (476 K.).<a href="#linknote-290066" name="linknoteref-290066"
      id="linknoteref-290066"> 66 </a> In other songs we discern musical genius
      divining and bringing to light the poetic germ which lies hidden in the
      words; here we have the impression made upon Mozart by true poetry. It may
      seem remarkable that so simple a lyrical poem should have been treated by
      Mozart as a romance, giving a certain amount of dramatic detail to the
      little story; and yet it must not be overlooked that the masterly touch
      which repeats the closing words: "Das arme Veilchen! es war ein herzigs
       <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p374.png">[374]</a></span> Veilchen!"
      fully reasserts a genuine lyric element.<a href="#linknote-290067"
      name="linknoteref-290067" id="linknoteref-290067"> 67 </a> A tendency to
      dramatic effect was inherent in Mozart's nature as an artist, and Goethe's
      clear and plastic presentation of a simple image, true in every feature,
      could not fail to impress him deeply. The poem must have fallen into his
      hands by some accident; had he known others of them, he would certainly
      have preferred them to Weisse's. Why did he not seek them out? He does not
      seem to have sought out any poems for composition, but took what came, and
      Goethe had scarcely penetrated to the circle in which he lived. Had the
      springtime of German poetry been opened before his day, what inspirations
      might he not have drawn from its source!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's labours as a song composer are not by any means on a level with
      those in the other branches of his art, although even here his artistic
      nature could not fail to make itself felt. Beethoven followed him closely
      in his manner of song-writing, and walked steadily to the last in the path
      indicated by Mozart.

    <p>
      OTTFRIED, Baron van Swieten, <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p374.png">[374]</a></span>was a man
      who exercised, in more than one
      respect, an important influence on Mozart's career. He was born in 1734,
      the son of the Empress Maria Theresa's celebrated and influential
      physician Gerhard van Swieten, who had removed with his family from Leyden
      to Vienna in 1745. Gottfried devoted himself to the study of the law, and
      pursued a diplomatic career,<a href="#linknote-30001"
      name="linknoteref-30001" id="linknoteref-30001"> 1 </a> but from his youth
      up he had been passionately fond of music, and had turned his studies in
      the art to practical, <span class="side">MUSIC IN BERLIN.</span> <span

      very successful account. In 1769 Favart's "RosiÃ¨re de Salency" was
      produced in Paris with music by different composers; Van Swieten wrote
      several of the songs, but they failed to attract much praise.<a
      href="#linknote-30002" name="linknoteref-30002" id="linknoteref-30002"> 2
      </a> He also composed eight symphonies "as stiff as himself," as Haydn
      said.<a href="#linknote-30003" name="linknoteref-30003"
      id="linknoteref-30003"> 3 </a> In 1771 Joseph II. appointed him ambassador
      to the Court of Prussia,<a href="#linknote-30004" name="linknoteref-30004"

      and speaks of him as "an enthusiastic amateur and connoisseur, and even a
      composer."<a href="#linknote-30005" name="linknoteref-30005"
      id="linknoteref-30005"> 5 </a> His residence in Berlin was important for
      the development of his musical taste and the ideas which he afterwards
      undertook to introduce in Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1740, Frederick the Great had erected the Berlin Opera House, and
      produced the Italian opera seria of the time with all the brilliancy of
      first-rate performers and scenic accessories.<a href="#linknote-30006"
      name="linknoteref-30006" id="linknoteref-30006"> 6 </a> Grand operas
      (interrupted, however, by the Seven Years War) were regularly given; the
      King used to sit in the pit immediately behind the conductor, so as to be
      able to look over his score.<a href="#linknote-30007"
      name="linknoteref-30007" id="linknoteref-30007"> 7 </a> He held firm to
      his original principles of taste; would admit nothing but opera seria, and
      no new works except those of Hasse and Graun. The Kapellmeister Carl
      Heinrich Graun (1709-1759) was obliged to compose the operas (to which the
      King furnished libretti in French, to be turned into Italian<a
      href="#linknote-30008" name="linknoteref-30008" id="linknoteref-30008"> 8
      </a>), and hurried over his uncongenial task; they were always submitted
      to the King, and what he disapproved of had to be altered.<a
      href="#linknote-30009" name="linknoteref-30009" id="linknoteref-30009"> 9
      </a> He preferred Hasse's composition on account of his greater fire and
      passion, while Graun (highly prized as a singer by his royal master)<a
      href="#linknote-300010" name="linknoteref-300010" id="linknoteref-300010">
      10 </a> heard little but blame for his shortcomings as a composer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this, he had to produce his opera year <span class="side">VAN
      SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p376.png">[376]</a></span> after year, and matters
      continued unchanged.<a href="#linknote-300011" name="linknoteref-300011"
      id="linknoteref-300011"> 11 </a> Johann Friedrich Agricola (1720-1774),
      who succeeded Graun in 1760, wrote little himself, except some pieces for
      insertion in old operas, which are kept in the same style. The King would
      have nothing to say to any other composers, and received Reichardt with
      the advice: "Have a care of the new Italians; the fellows write like
      pigs."<a href="#linknote-300012" name="linknoteref-300012"
      id="linknoteref-300012"> 12 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reichardt, in applying for Agricola's post after the death of the latter
      in 1775, was obliged to support his claims by the production of an opera,
      "modelled on the pattern of Graun and Hasse";<a href="#linknote-300013"
      name="linknoteref-300013" id="linknoteref-300013"> 13 </a> as
      kapellmeister, he must not dream of striking out in any other direction.
      For the last ten years of his life the King took little interest in
      musical matters; Italian opera lingered on with the pieces of Graun and
      Hasse, but it sank lower and lower.<a href="#linknote-300014"
      name="linknoteref-300014" id="linknoteref-300014"> 14 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side with the opera, however, which followed so closely the
      Italian tradition, there arose in Berlin a peculiar form of instrumental
      music founded on the Saxon school. The King, as is well known, gave a
      private concert every evening, and performed on the flute pieces composed
      by himself or his master Quanz, who wrote over three hundred such for
      Frederick.<a href="#linknote-300015" name="linknoteref-300015"

      16 </a> to whom the King had been much attached from his earliest years,
      was supreme in all matters musical, and was nicknamed the "Pope of the
      Berlin music."<a href="#linknote-300017" name="linknoteref-300017"

      Quanz in Frederick's favour stood Franz Benda (1709-1786),<a

      execution was peculiar to himself, and rested mainly on a pure and
      expressive delivery. His brother Joseph (1724-1804) and the sons of both
      followed in his footsteps, and the Concertmeister J. Gottlieb Graun
      (1698-1771) highly esteemed as a violin-player and instrumental composer,
      may be said to have belonged to the same school. By these distinguished
      artists the Berlin orchestra was formed and trained to a degree of
      excellence second only to that of Dresden, and not until later surpassed
      by Mannheim and Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest rank among the artists of Berlin must be accorded to Philipp
      Emanuel Bach (1714-1788).<a href="#linknote-300020"
      name="linknoteref-300020" id="linknoteref-300020"> 20 </a> He was summoned
      to the Prussian capital in 1738 as accompanist to the then Crown Prince,
      and after 1756 he shared the office with Fasch. He was an accomplished and
      tasteful accompanist, but the wearisome monotony of the royal concerts
      disgusted him, and as an artist he could not but be annoyed at the King's
      narrow prejudices. He revenged himself by refusing to comply when
      Frederick, who liked to play in "various times" required his accompanist
      to give way to him. This led to a dislike on the King's part, which
      prevented him from duly appreciating Bach;<a href="#linknote-300021"
      name="linknoteref-300021" id="linknoteref-300021"> 21 </a> and the latter
      willingly obeyed a summons to Hamburg in 1767, to fill Telemann's place.
      His technical studies, founded on J. Sebastian Bach's system of fingering,
      and his clavier sonatas entitle him to be considered as the father of
      modem pianoforte-playing, and Haydn acknowledged him alone as his model.<a

      equal respect as a man of cultivation and good-breeding. Nicolai declares

      school of Hasse and Graun, and he was mainly, though far from exclusively,<a

      The position of music in Berlin was peculiar in that it had gained
      recognition for itself, even in respect of its literature. Not a few
      musicians were cultivated and scientific men, ready with their pen and
      anxious to employ it in the <span class="side">KIRN BERGER&mdash;MARPURG.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p379.png">[379]</a></span> musical
      cause. Quanz's "Course of Flute-Playing" (1752) was followed by Ph. Em.
      Bach's "True Art of Playing the Clavier" (1753, 1761) and Agricola's
      "Introduction to the Art of Song" (1757); and together with these may be
      noted Marpurg's "Art of Playing the Clavier" (1750), "Introduction to
      Clavier-Playing" (1755, 1765), and "Introduction to Music and Singing"
      (1763); it was no small honour for Leop. Mozart's "Violin Method" to find
      recognition in this circle (Vol. I., p. 16). The writings of the advocate
      Krause on musical poetry (1752), of Nichelmann on melody (1755), and
      Marpurg's "Introduction to Vocal Composition" (1758) must not be omitted
      from the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of harmony and counterpoint was studied with equal zeal, and
      Kimberger and Marpurg have earned for themselves a place of honour in the
      history of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joh. Phil. Kimberger (1721-1783), Kammermusicus to the Princess Amalie, a
      pupil of Seb. Bach, was of small merit as a composer, but, being a
      sagacious man, and fond of research, he busied himself in tracing the
      principles and maxims of composition through the works of his revered
      master.<a href="#linknote-300029" name="linknoteref-300029"
      id="linknoteref-300029"> 29 </a> The gift of literary expression was
      denied to him by his education and manner of life; and unless he were
      assisted by friends such as Agricola, Sulzer, or his pupil Schulz, he
      found it difficult to express his views with clearness.<a
      href="#linknote-300030" name="linknoteref-300030" id="linknoteref-300030">
      30 </a> His intellect, knowledge, and study were considerable, his
      character open and estimable;<a href="#linknote-300031"
      name="linknoteref-300031" id="linknoteref-300031"> 31 </a> but he was
      embittered by the want of the recognition which he believed to be his due.
      Want of refinement led him to turn his critical acumen into a weapon of
      attack, which he often used in a manner both spiteful and unjust.<a
      href="#linknote-300032" name="linknoteref-300032" id="linknoteref-300032">
      32 </a> Quanz had maintained that a <span class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND
      CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p380.png">[380]</a></span>
      genuine duet admitted of no bass, and published some duets to prove his
      point; Kimberger played the duets on the church organ while Quanz was
      receiving the communion, with a bass added.<a href="#linknote-300033"
      name="linknoteref-300033" id="linknoteref-300033"> 33 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Friedr. Wilh. Marpurg (1718-1795) thereupon took up the cudgels, and
      endeavoured to prove from Kimberger's fugues that he was the last man who
      had a right to make himself conspicuous as a critic. This gave rise to a
      feud, which was carried on with great bitterness on both sides, respecting
      various principles of musical theory. Marpurg had the advantage of a
      thorough school and university education. As private secretary to General
      Bodenberg he had enjoyed intercourse with Voltaire, D'Alembert, and
      Maupertuis, and a lengthened stay in Paris in 1746 had made him familiar
      with the French cultivation of the time. After 1749 he lived in Berlin. In
      his youth he had been the friend of Winckelmann<a href="#linknote-300034"
      name="linknoteref-300034" id="linknoteref-300034"> 34 </a> and the
      companion of Lessing, in his jovial hours as well as in his studies and
      controversies.<a href="#linknote-300035" name="linknoteref-300035"
      id="linknoteref-300035"> 35 </a> Shrewd and thorough in matters of
      research, and of passionate temper, he could neither brook contradiction
      nor control his violence;<a href="#linknote-300036"
      name="linknoteref-300036" id="linknoteref-300036"> 36 </a> and superior as
      he was to Kirnberger in powers of expression, he yielded nothing to him in
      coarseness and virulence of attack.<a href="#linknote-300037"

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another influence on musical affairs in Berlin remains to be noted,
      viz., the musical journals edited by Marpurg and the musicians and
      scholars associated with him&mdash;"The Musical Critic on the River Spree"
      (1749-1750), "Critical and Historical Contributions to the Study of Music"
      (1754-1762), and "Critical Letters on Music" (1760-1764).
    </p>
    <p>
      Music was treated also by literary men from a more general point of view.
      Sulzer included music in his <span class="side">LIBBHABERCONCERT IN BERLIN</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p381.png">[381]</a></span>
      "Treatise on the Fine Arts" (1771-1774), and sought counsel of
      professional men better versed in the art than himself. He selected
      Kirnberger as the fittest man for his purpose, and after him his pupil J.
      A. P. Schulz, who was inferior to his master in scholarly acquirements,
      but far superior to him in clearness and facility.<a
      href="#linknote-300038" name="linknoteref-300038" id="linknoteref-300038">
      38 </a> The great influence which Sulzer's work exercised in Germany
      caused his views upon music therein expressed to be appealed to as a sort
      of final authority. Fr. Nicolai was exceedingly fond of music, and made it
      a practical study.<a href="#linknote-300039" name="linknoteref-300039"
      id="linknoteref-300039"> 39 </a> He was personally acquainted with all the
      great musicians, especially Agricola, Marpurg, and Reichardt, and he set
      himself seriously to form musical opinions founded on his own observation.
      When he undertook the German Universal Cyclopedia in 1765, he included
      music in the list of subjects treated. Nicolai's influence in Berlin was
      great,<a href="#linknote-300040" name="linknoteref-300040"
      id="linknoteref-300040"> 40 </a> and a literary organ of so much
      importance could not fail to give weight and consideration to musical
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical result of these musical efforts, so far as they did not
      proceed immediately from the King, consisted mainly in the
      "Liebhaberconcert," founded in 1770, and held every Friday evening under
      Nicolai's direction.<a href="#linknote-300041" name="linknoteref-300041"
      id="linknoteref-300041"> 41 </a> All available forces were assembled on
      these occasions; orchestral works, native or foreign, were performed,
      vocal and instrumental virtuosi found an audience, and great vocal
      compositions were frequently produced, such as Graun's and Ph. Eman.
      Bach's sacred music, and what is more noteworthy, Handel's oratorios,
      especially "Judas MaccabÃ¦us," the "Feast of Alexander," and the "Messiah."<a

      intention, and efforts after intellectual comprehension in art, deserve
      all recognition, even when united with partiality, pedantry, and
      quarrelsomeness. The supremacy claimed by Frederick the Great's capital,
      even in music, extended to South Germany, and especially to Vienna.
      Wagenseil and Steffan, at that time men of considerable note in Vienna,
      are complacently taken to task by Marpurg.<a href="#linknote-300043"
      name="linknoteref-300043" id="linknoteref-300043"> 43 </a> Nicolai openly
      says<a href="#linknote-300044" name="linknoteref-300044"
      id="linknoteref-300044"> 44 </a> that after Fux's death Vienna had various
      good composers, but no extraordinary genius worthy to rank with Seb. and
      Ph. Em. Bach, Telemann, Graun, or Hasse, men who had determined the course
      of musical progress in North Germany until Haydn appeared. The Viennese,
      on the other hand, were entirely ignorant of all that concerned music in
      North Germany, and especially in Berlin.<a href="#linknote-300045"

      Youthful impulses could not altogether fail, however, to stir the musical
      world of Berlin. The French operetta, conducted for a long time by Schulz,<a
      href="#linknote-300046" name="linknoteref-300046" id="linknoteref-300046">
      46 </a> and still more the German opera after 1771,<a

      47 </a> had the effect of gradually reforming the taste of the general
      public. Prince Henry, who had an excellent band in his pay, was by no
      means so devoted to old music and the old composers as the King.<a

      It was into this peculiar musical atmosphere, so different from that of
      Vienna, that Van Swieten entered at Berlin. His turn of mind being
      essentially rational and methodical,<a href="#linknote-300059"
      name="linknoteref-300059" id="linknoteref-300059"> 59 </a> disposed him to
      sympathy with the severe Berlin school, and to a partiality for a concise
      style; he was enchanted with the music of Handel and Bach, which he
      brought back with him to Vienna, and turned to account by means of his
      personal <span class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p384.png">[384]</a></span> friendship
      with Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. He commissioned Ph. Em. Bach to compose,
      in 1774, six grand orchestral symphonies, with the express wish that he
      would allow his genius full play, without any regard to difficulty of
      execution.<a href="#linknote-300060" name="linknoteref-300060"
      id="linknoteref-300060"> 60 </a> In Berlin also Van Swieten became better
      acquainted with Haydn than was possible in Vienna, and like Mozart and the
      youthful Beethoven, he' loved and reverenced him next to Handel and Bach.
      "As far as music is concerned," he writes (December, 1798), "I have gone
      back to the times when it was thought necessary before practising an art
      to study it thoroughly and systematically. In such study I find
      nourishment for my mind and heart, and support when any fresh proof of the
      degeneracy of the art threatens to cast me down. My chief comforters are
      Handel and the Bachs, and with them the few masters of our own day who
      tread firmly in the footsteps of the truly great and good, and either give
      promise of reaching the same goal, or have already attained to it. In this
      there can be no doubt that Mozart, had he been spared to us, would have
      succeeded; Joseph Haydn stands actually at the goal."<a
      href="#linknote-300061" name="linknoteref-300061" id="linknoteref-300061">
      61 </a> On his return to Vienna (which took place about 1778) he at once
      assumed a position of great importance. He succeeded to his father's
      office as Prefect of the Imperial Library, was appointed President of the
      Education Commission in 1781, and intrusted with the conduct of the
      educational scheme which was introduced throughout the Empire in 1783.
      Knowledge, intelligence, and zeal he certainly possessed;<a
      href="#linknote-300062" name="linknoteref-300062" id="linknoteref-300062">
      62 </a> but he was wanting in the energy and decision necessary to carry
      out the projects he conceived.<a href="#linknote-300063"
      name="linknoteref-300063" id="linknoteref-300063"> 63 </a> His influential
      position, rank, and wealth, the hereditary fame of his family, and the
      importance of his mission at the court of Frederick the Great, gave him
      the right to a place among the most distinguished society. He exerted all
      his influence in the cause of music, even for so subordinate an <span
      class="side">VAN SWIETEN'S PERSONAL INFLUENCE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p385.png">[385]</a></span> end as to enforce silence and
      attention during musical performances. Whenever a whispered conversation
      arose among the audience, his excellency would rise from his seat in the
      first row, draw himself up to his full majestic height, measure the
      offenders with a long, serious look, and then very slowly resume his seat.
      The proceeding never failed of its effect.<a href="#linknote-300064"
      name="linknoteref-300064" id="linknoteref-300064"> 64 </a> Van Swieten was
      not liberal in money matters; he always had it in his power to collect
      money among his friends of high rank for musical purposes, and he did not
      fail on such occasions to contribute his own quota;<a
      href="#linknote-300065" name="linknoteref-300065" id="linknoteref-300065">
      65 </a> but he was not by any means generous for a wealthy and childless
      man. Haydn's experience supported this view,<a href="#linknote-300066"
      name="linknoteref-300066" id="linknoteref-300066"> 66 </a> and the
      eulogies pronounced on Van Swieten's benevolence to Mozart's family after
      his death<a href="#linknote-300067" name="linknoteref-300067"
      id="linknoteref-300067"> 67 </a> have no foundation; in fact, he did
      nothing worth mentioning for them. In his intercourse with artists,
      however highly he might estimate them and their works, his demeanour was
      always that of a grand seigneur, and he enforced his own views with an air
      of somewhat overbearing superiority. This was again Haydn's experience,<a
      href="#linknote-300068" name="linknoteref-300068" id="linknoteref-300068">
      68 </a> and Mozart can scarcely have escaped some measure of annoyance
      from the same source.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such personal failings as these are cast into the shade by the merit
      which is due to Van Swieten as the man who awoke interest in Vienna for
      severe and classical music. His influence upon Mozart is unmistakable. At
      the beginning of 1782 we find them in constant intercourse, and Mozart
      habitually present at Van Swieten's musical Sunday mornings, at which
      music in the severe style only was performed. He had, as Mozart writes to
      his sister (April 20, 1782), "a stock of music good in point of value, but
      small in quantity"; and in order to add to it, Mozart requests his father
      to send him both his own church compositions, and <span class="side">VAN
      SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p386.png">[386]</a></span> some select works of Michael
      Haydn and Eberlin, which he had formerly copied (Vol. I., p. 238); they
      were performed with great applause in the little circle, These
      performances were clearly not intended for an audience; for Van Swieten
      sang tenor, Mozart alto (at the same time playing the pianoforte), Starzer<a
      href="#linknote-300069" name="linknoteref-300069" id="linknoteref-300069">
      69 </a> tenor, and young Tebery,<a href="#linknote-300070"
      name="linknoteref-300070" id="linknoteref-300070"> 70 </a> who had just
      returned from Italy, bass (MÃ¤rch 12, 1783). But in this way they became
      familiar with the best works of masters who had been hitherto unheard in
      Vienna. "It is a fact," writes Mozart (April 12,1783), "that the change of
      taste has extended even to church music, which is much to be regretted; so
      it comes that the best church music lies worm-eaten in the garret."<a
      href="#linknote-300071" name="linknoteref-300071" id="linknoteref-300071">
      71 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Clavier music of the same school also found a place in Van Swieten's
      musical meetings. Mozart writes to his father (April 10, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you would send me Handel's six fugues and the toccata and fugues by
      Eberlin. I go every Sunday morning to the Baron van Swieten, and nothing
      is played there but Handel and Bach. I am making a collection of the Bach
      fugues, Sebastian's as well as Emanuel's and Friedemann's, and also of
      Handel's, and I want just these six. Also, I should like to let the Baron
      hear Eberlin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the latter, however, he writes soon after to his sister (April
      20, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If my father has not yet had Eberlin's works copied, pray countermand
      them. I have found them here, and see (now that I refresh my memory of
      them) that they are very trivial and unworthy of a place with Handel and
      Bach. His four-part movement deserves all respect, but his clavier fugues
      are simply <i>versetti</i> spun out to great length.

    <p>
      <span class="side">PIANOFORTE FUGUES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p387.png">[387]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen already how Mozart's interest in the study of these masters
      was still further kindled by the pleasure his wife took in fugues (Vol.
      II., p. 267). When he sent his sister a three-part fugue with a prelude,
      he wrote to her (April 20, 1782) that if time and opportunity served, he
      meant to write five more fugues, and present them all to Van Swieten; she
      must therefore keep this one to herself, learn it by heart, and play it;
      "it is not so easy to play fugues." A second (39 Anh. K.) has only the
      theme with one answer written down:&mdash;[See Page Images]

    <p>
      A third is rather more finished (40 Anh. K.), and its very original
      subject promises an interesting elaboration&mdash;

      Mozart twice projected arranging Frohberger's "Phantasia supra Ut, re, mi,
      fa, sol, la" for the pianoforte,<a href="#linknote-300072"
      name="linknoteref-300072" id="linknoteref-300072"> 72 </a> but neither
      time did he accomplish his intention (292 Anh. K.). The three-part fugue
      in C major, which has been published (394 K.), probably the same that
      Mozart sent to his sister with a prelude, gives an idea of his intentions.
      A four-part fugue in G minor, wanting only a few bars, was finished and
      published by Stadler (401 K.). Only sketches remain of other clavier
      fugues. The most finished (26 bars) is a fugue in G major (23 Anh. K.):&mdash;[See

    </p>
    <p>
      To the same time and school belongs the great fugue for two pianofortes in
      C minor, composed on December 29,1783 (426 K.). The beginning is preserved
      of another fugue for two pianofortes in G major of a totally different
      character (45 Anh. K.):&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      We may judge of the manner in which Mozart wished his fugues to be played
      from an expression to his sister, when he sent her the first of them
      (April 20, 1782):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have taken care to write "andante maestoso" on it, that it may not be
      played too fast; for, if a fugue is not played slowly, the recurring
      subject is not distinctly and clearly heard, and so loses its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards (in June, 1788) Mozart arranged the C minor fugue for his
      string quartet, and wrote "a short adagio" as an introduction (546 K.),
      probably for Van Swieten, with whom he was then in closer intercourse than
      ever, in consequence of the instrumentation and performance of Handel's
      oratorios.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ease and distinctness with which four-part movements of this metrical
      style could thus be executed, had already suggested to Mozart the
      arrangement of five fugues from Bach's "Wohltemperirte Klavier," for
      stringed instruments (405 K.). The handwriting points to 1782 or 1783,
      when Van Swieten's influence was at its highest. The fugues selected,
      doubtless with a view to their suitability for the purpose, were (in
      Breitkopf and HÃ¤rtel's edition): <span class="side">KLAVIERSUITE,
      1782-1783.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p389.png">[389]</a></span>
      No. 2, in C minor; No. 7, in E fiat major; No. 9, in E major; No. 8,
      transposed from D sharp major to D major; and No. 5, in D major.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting illustration of the pleasure with which Mozart sought to
      follow in the steps of Handel and Bach, is afforded by the unfinished
      "Klaviersuite" (399 K.) belonging to 1782 or 1783. It begins, according to
      rule, with an overture (C major) consisting of two movements, a slow
      introduction in imitation, and a fugued Allegro closing on the dominant.
      Then follows, after traditional usage, an Allemande (C minor), a Courante
      (E flat major), and a Sarabande (G minor); of this last, however, only six
      bars are written. The imitation of the older masters is unmistakable in
      the design and many of the details of the movements, the only novelty
      being the changes of key. They may, in this sense, be considered as
      studies; but Mozart's originality constantly asserts itself, and the
      Courante in especial is completely imbued with it. Still more original and
      free is the "Short Gigue for the Klavier," which Mozart wrote on May 17,
      1789, "in the album of Herr Engel, court organist in Leipzig" (574 K.), no
      doubt in remembrance of Bach, whose motetts he had there heard for the
      first time with unbounded delight. The light and flexible gigue had been
      transformed by Bach's freer, and at the same time severer, treatment into
      a fantastic, almost humorous movement, which took the same place in the
      suite that was afterwards given to the scherzo in the sonata. Mozart
      selected the severer style, and the intellectual skill with which the
      strictest forms of counterpoint, harmony, and rhythm are so freely and
      archly treated, as to make both player and listener hold their breath from
      surprise, renders this little composition a masterpiece. It causes regret
      that the suite, containing as it did so many elements capable of
      development, was not seriously taken up and carried to perfection by
      Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that Mozart's study of Bach and Handel had no
      result but to teach him to write fugues; his earlier compositions show him
      to have been no novice in the art of counterpoint. What he found most
      admirable in <span class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p390.png">[390]</a></span> these
      masters was their power of making forms strict even to rigidity the medium
      of a natural expression of their musical ideas and emotions; their use of
      all the available wealth of contrapuntal combinations was no mere trick of
      barren speculation, but a deliberate selection of a means of expression
      from the inexhaustible fund of their productive powers. That this was the
      sense in which Mozart reverenced his masters is proved by his criticism of
      Eberlin and of Hassler, who had learnt Bach's harmonies and modulations by
      heart, but was unable to work out an original fugue; and it is proved more
      satisfactorily still by his own works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in compositions avowedly written as studies, Mozart's originality
      appears, and in his later works there is no trace of any attempt at
      servile imitation of Bach or Handel.<a href="#linknote-300073"
      name="linknoteref-300073" id="linknoteref-300073"> 73 </a> He imitated,
      not their work, but their way of working, drew from the sources to which
      they had given him access, and employed that which he received from them
      in accordance with his own nature and the task before him.<a

    <p>
      Master-strokes of genius in many pieces of his chamber music&mdash;as also
      in the last movement of the C major symphony, and in the overture to the
      "Zauberflote," where art reaches its highest pitch in the union of
      strictest form with freest fancy&mdash;may be ascribed in no small degree
      to the impulses arising from his study of Bach and Handel. But their
      influence reaches beyond his compositions in the severe style. The
      perfection of <i>polyphonic</i> composition which characterises all
      Mozart's works, and wherein consists one of his chief merits, rests, even
      in its broadest and freest development, upon the foundations laid by those
      <span class="side">PIANOFORTE FUGUES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p391.png">[391]</a></span> masters. So, too, the fertility
      and boldness of Mozart's harmonic treatment may be traced back to the same
      source. Harmonic beauties, novel and striking transitions and turns, are
      frequent enough in his earlier works, but they are simply harmonic
      combinations, whereas in his later works they appear as a free and
      intellectual development of the polyphonic principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the influence of the older masters and their works is observable in
      a certain harshness occasioned by independence in the disposition of
      parts, which Mozart does not by any means seek to avoid. In this respect
      he makes demands upon his audience as great and greater than those, for
      instance, of Bach and Beethoven, and may be compared to Sophocles, who,
      admired as he justly was by the ancients for his sweetness and charm, did
      not hesitate upon occasion to startle his hearers with his harsh severity.
      Mozart's severity is never the result of clumsy workmanship, but is a
      conscious and deliberate choice of means; neither is it employed as a
      stimulant, but rather as an incentive to a better appreciation of passages
      of perfect beauty. The sense of deliverance from conflict and obscurity,
      and passage into calmness and light, is so striking that it cannot be
      wondered at if the means whereby it is attained are little analysed.<a

    <p>
      Among the compositions in precise or metrical style special interest
      attaches to the three-part pianoforte fugue in C major (394 K.). It opens
      with an introduction, more elaborate than a prelude, and entitled,
      therefore, a "fantasia." Such introductions, not always in free form
      (sometimes called "toc-cate"), were usually prefixed to a fugue or other
      composition in order to give it the character of an improvisation; several
      others by Mozart exist. The one in question, after a few slow bars, is a
      lively movement, varies its key continually, and does not carry out fully
      any motif or passage; this agitated unrest gives it a pathetic character,
      and excites expectation; the whole movement is brilliant and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      It closes on the dominant, thus announcing its nature as an <span
      class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p392.png">[392]</a></span> introduction. The fugue which
      follows is in striking contrast, firm and quiet, yet full of life and
      latent emotion:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The two first bars, with their intervals of fourths, announce a more
      serviceable than individually expressive subject, but the agitated motif
      which follows has a very original character, heightened by its auxiliary
      notes and by its rapid succession of sharp dissonants. A gentle, almost
      melancholy, tone pervades the whole fugue, and is expressed also by its
      frequent passage into a minor key. Apart from its interesting technical
      elaboration, it is important by reason of its characteristic expression,
      and may serve as an illustration of Mozart's complete mastery of the fugue
      form. To this it may be added that the fugue we are considering is
      essentially adapted for the pianoforte both in conception and composition.
      This is not the case in the same degree with the G minor Fugue (401 K.),
      which is artistically worked out, but not equal to the C major either in
      breadth of expression or adaptation to the nature of > the instrument. The
      same may be said of the three-part fugue in D major, of which Mozart has
      written thirty-seven bars (443 Anh., 67 K.). The effect of the C minor
      fugue (426 K), also, rests neither on the sound effects of the pianoforte
      nor on those of the stringed instruments. It is so broadly conceived, so
      earnestly and with such ruthless severity carried out, that the external
      means of expression fall into the background before the energetic
      enunciation of the laws of form, obeyed consciously, but without
      servility.<a href="#linknote-300076" name="linknoteref-300076"
      id="linknoteref-300076"> 76 </a> Quite otherwise is the <span class="side">FUGUE

      href="pgimages/p393.png">[393]</a></span> case with the introduction,
      which, written originally for strings, is expressly adapted to their
      peculiarities of sound effect. The harmonic treatment, and more especially
      the enharmonic changes, are of extraordinary beauty and depth, and
      occasion remarkable effects of suspense and climax. Most admirable is the
      art with which the character of the movement as an introduction is
      maintained, and the defiant style of the following fugue clearly
      indicated, at the same time that the mind is tuned to a pitch of longing
      and melancholy which makes the entry of the categorical fugue a positive
      relief and stimulant.

      A fugue for four stringed instruments in D minor, of which the first
      elaboration is indicated in the sketch (76 Anh. K.)&mdash;[See Page Image]

      appears well suited to the instruments. Whether it was to form a movement
      in a quartet or an independent piece we have no means of ascertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears fitting to cast a glance in this place on two works belonging
      to a later time, but falling within the same school of composition. These
      are the two "Pieces for an <span class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL
      MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p394.png">[394]</a></span>
      organ in a clock," in F minor,<a href="#linknote-300077"
      name="linknoteref-300077" id="linknoteref-300077"> 77 </a> which have been
      published, and are well known as Fantasia and Sonata for the Pianoforte,
      for four hands. They both consist of a slow movement and another in
      lively, metrical style; their design is similar, but not identical. The
      first, composed in December, 1790 (594 K), opens with a solemn Adagio,
      whose impression of great gentleness is not disturbed by some harmonic
      harshness; it keeps strictly within the limits of an introduction. The
      Allegro in F major, formed by the imitative treatment of an agitated
      motif, is divided sonata-like into two parts, and returns through an
      harmonic transition to the Adagio, which is modified in a masterly way,
      and leads to a calm conclusion. The whole piece is marvellously rounded
      off; and the restlessness of the Allegro contrasts with, but does not
      oppose, the gentle expression of the Adagio. Each forms the fitting
      complement to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second piece (608 K.), composed on March 3, 1791, is more broadly
      planned, and has a greater depth of feeling. It begins with the Allegro,
      the first bars of which serve to introduce a fugue, admirably disposed and
      full of lovely melody, with a general tone of serious contemplation. When
      the fugue has been brought to a close by a stretto with the subject
      inverted, a striking harmonic transition leads back to the opening motif,
      which passes into the Andante in A flat major. Its treatment as a middle
      movement is more weighty and elaborate. A well-developed motif recurs
      again and again in varied figuration, connected by different interludes,
      and gives a general impression of pure and satisfied grace, touched with a
      breath of melancholy recollection, the natural development of the powerful
      feeling and contemplative spirit of the Allegro. But this happy calm is of
      short duration. The first movement returns; the fugue recommences,
      rendered more animated than before by a countersubject, and breaks off
      with a passionate conclusion.

    <p>
      These two compositions are a fresh proof of Mozart's deep insight into the
      nature of the forms of counterpoint, which gave him power to use them as
      the free expression of his individual nature; he is entitled to the praise
      of having brought these forms to their fullest perfection, an incalculable
      gain to the development of music, which has proceeded in other directions
      since his time. It is sometimes regretted that Mozart should have wasted
      his genius and his labour upon compositions for a toy clock.<a
      href="#linknote-300078" name="linknoteref-300078" id="linknoteref-300078">
      78 </a> We may rather remark how like a true artist he set himself to
      perform the task before him, and produced a work which, keeping within its
      given conditions, forms, nevertheless, a great and harmonious whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart, having become acquainted through Van Swieten with the vocal
      compositions of Handel, Bach, and other masters of the church style,
      turned, as might be expected, with renewed zeal to this branch of musical
      art. Unfortunately, upon the introduction of the new regulations in church
      matters in 1783, the Emperor Joseph prohibited the performance of figured
      or instrumental church music in the churches of Vienna, and it was only at
      the court chapel or St. Stephen's cathedral, when the Archbishop
      celebrated, that musical masses could be performed. German congregational
      singing was substituted in other cases;<a href="#linknote-300079"
      name="linknoteref-300079" id="linknoteref-300079"> 79 </a> it was not
      liked, and many complaints were made that the total abolition of church
      music should have been deemed the only remedy for its abuses.<a
      href="#linknote-300080" name="linknoteref-300080" id="linknoteref-300080">
      80 </a> Thus Mozart was deprived of all hope of success in this direction.
      But he had undertaken in 1782, in performance of a vow, to compose a Mass
      for Salzburg; and this work bears distinct traces of the studies which
      were occupying him at the time. Mozart completed the Kyrie, Gloria,
      Sanctus, and Benedictus of this Mass in C minor (427 K.); the first
      movement of the Credo is <span class="side">VAN SWIETEN AND CLASSICAL
      MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p396.png">[396]</a></span>
      complete as to the choir parts and bass, and the essential points of the
      accompaniment are indicated; in the same way the voices, obbligato wind
      instruments, and bass of the Incarnatus are fully written out, the rest of
      the accompaniment being only indicated. The whole plan and treatment of
      the Mass differ from those of the earlier ones. In the latter, limitation
      to a narrow standard and the subservience of the parts to the whole are
      the prevailing principles, while in the former the effort is evident to
      give as wide a signification as possible to each part in itself. With this
      object each section of the text is treated as an independent movement; the
      Gloria consists of seven completely detached pieces. The mechanism
      corresponds to its external divisions, and the treatment throughout is
      thematic and elaborate, for the most part in strict form. A wealth of
      resource is displayed in the means employed to give the desired effect;
      several of the choruses are five-part, one is eight-part, and then again
      four solo voices are introduced in various ways. The orchestra necessarily
      complies with the usual Salzburg conditions; the brass instruments are
      completely appointed, but neither flutes nor clarinets are used with the
      oboes and bassoons&mdash;all the effect of independence possible is given,
      chiefly by the skilful introduction and treatment of obbligato
      instruments. It cannot be said, however, that the instrumental part of
      this work is as brilliant and full of colour as others composed at the
      same period; the tone-colouring is on the whole monotonous; but there are
      not wanting some original instrumental effects, principally of the wind
      instruments. Such is the employment of the trombones (usually only a
      support to the voices), with independent effect in several parts of the
      Kyrie and Sanctus. The effect of the whole accompaniment consists mainly
      in the independence with which it contrasts with the voices, and is
      produced partly by effective passages and partly by skilful contrapuntal
      elaboration. That which most strikes us on a careful examination of this
      Mass is the dissimilarity of the movements in many respects, suggesting
      that it was undertaken as a study. The solo movements are the most
      important, more especially by reason of their bravura <span class="side">THE
      C MINOR MASS, 1782.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p397.png">[397]</a></span> treatment. Bravura was not
      considered by any means out of place in church music, and even the
      classical masters of the last century&mdash;such as Handel and Bach&mdash;did
      not exclude it from their sacred works. But it is curious that Mozart, who
      only introduced bravura into his dramatic music from complaisance to the
      singers, should have made concessions to the taste for it in this Mass.
      The first grand soprano solo is quite after the pattern of an old bravura
      aria, and displays little or nothing of Mozart's originality. It is so
      suggestive of the style of Graun or Hasse that we are inclined to suspect
      the influence of these masters through Van Swieten. More of Mozart's own
      character is given to the Incarnatus est, accompanied by the wind
      instruments, and containing touches of delicacy and grace; but the bravura
      goes beyond all bounds, especially in the twenty-two bars of cadenza for
      the voice and wind instruments. The duet for two sopranos, Domine Deus,
      and the terzet for two sopranos and tenor, Quoniam tu solus, are written
      in stricter form, both for voice and accompaniment, and are simpler and
      more dignified in expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inflexibility of form has something in it of pedantry; the work
      seems to be done as an exercise, and we seek in vain for the fresh
      wellings-up of inspiration which delight us even in less important
      compositions of Mozart. The same remark holds good of the choruses. The
      first five-part choral movement of the Credo accords most in design with
      the style of the earlier Masses. A lively subject shared between the
      strings and wind instruments forms, as it proceeds, the thread which binds
      the choral passages together; the latter are contrapuntally treated, and
      the whole movement is more solemn in tone than was usual in earlier works.
      The long fugue "Cum Sancto Spiritu" is admirably worked out, and, in spite
      of its difficulty, very clear. Notwithstanding all this, the nervous force
      of individual life is wanting to the work, and cannot be replaced by the
      artistic workmanship displayed in the different parts, even when these
      have force and character of their own, as for instance in the magnificent
      ending, when the voices in unison maintain the theme against a florid
      accompaniment.

    <p>
      The Osanna has more of independent life; it is a long, elaborately fugued
      movement, the technical interest of which has engrossed the composer
      longer than was necessary.<a href="#linknote-300081"
      name="linknoteref-300081" id="linknoteref-300081"> 81 </a> The Benedictus
      in four parts, and worked out at length, is remarkable on account of its
      earnest, somewhat dry tone, which effectually distinguishes it from the
      same movement in other masses, to which a soft and pleasing character was
      given. The Kyrie, Gloria, and Sanctus are very fine movements, in which
      the skilful rendering of strictest form does not overpower the expression
      of feeling and the truly musical proportions of the work. The varied
      expression of the different passages is so suitable, so clear and telling,
      that we may see at once how firm a grasp Mozart had taken of the true
      spirit of church music. The crown of the composition, however, is the
      five-part Gratias with the eight-part Qui tollis, which are planned and
      executed in masterly fashion, and are penetrated with Mozart's spirit and
      life. Their earnestness, severe even to harshness, their breadth of
      outline and massive effects, are worthy of the great examples who were
      vividly present to his mind; and we cannot fail to discern the master who
      was stimulated by these very examples to draw more deeply on the resources
      of his own creative genius, and to soar to higher realms of art by the
      exertion of his own powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first performance of the Mass in its unfinished state at
      Salzburg, in 1783, Mozart laid it aside for more pressing work. But when
      in 1785 he was commissioned to write an oratorio for the concert for the
      Musical Fund <span class="side">DAVIDE PENITENTE," 1785.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p399.png">[399]</a></span> (March 13 and
      14; Vol. II., p. 174), he determined to make use of the Kyrie and Gloria
      to which, with slight alterations, the Italian words of the "Davide
      Penitente" (469 K.) were adapted. He added (on March 6 and 11) two new
      arie for Mdlle. Cavalieri and Adamberger.<a href="#linknote-300082"
      name="linknoteref-300082" id="linknoteref-300082"> 82 </a> The work lost
      in unity of style more than it gained by the addition of these two songs,
      of which the orchestral accompaniment is in Mozart's later style, and the
      design and treatment are different from those of the other movements. They
      are both in the style of the concert arie of the time, and are quite equal
      to the best in expression and treatment of the voice. The Mozart-like
      character is more marked than in the rest of the work, but it does not
      reach its fullest development; and the arie are too florid for an
      oratorio. But the mixture of styles was then customary, and indeed
      brilliant solos were looked for by the public as a relief to the more
      serious choral movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present day there cannot be two opinions as to the impropriety of
      such a mixture.<a href="#linknote-300083" name="linknoteref-300083"
      id="linknoteref-300083"> 83 </a> The important point to be noted, however,
      is that just at the time when the instrumental and operatic music of
      Vienna threatened to banish altogether the severer and more classical
      style, Mozart <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p400.png">[400]</a></span>   became familiar through Van Swieten with the works of the classical masters. They
      laid deep hold on his imagination and intellect, giving him a powerful
      impulse to classical studies, without which his genius would not have
      arrived at a full mastery of his art; these studies, combined with his
      ever-growing powers of production, have impressed their indelible stamp
      upon the works of this period.<a href="#linknote-300084"

      AN account of the circumstances<span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p400.png">[400]</a></span> which affected Mozart's social and
      artistic position in Vienna, as well as his moral and intellectual
      development, would be incomplete without some notice of his connection
      with Freemasonry.<a href="#linknote-31001" name="linknoteref-31001"

      It is well known<a href="#linknote-31002" name="linknoteref-31002"
      id="linknoteref-31002"> 2 </a> that a propensity for secret associations
      and brotherhoods, having for their object the furtherance of intellectual,
      moral, and political ideas, was very prevalent in Germany during the
      latter half of the eighteenth century. These associations were all more or
      less closely allied to Freemasonry, and the traces of their influence are
      most apparent in the impulse which they gave to the national literature.<a

      cause of humanity, and granting that its good effects have often been
      obscured by the follies, crimes, and impostures which have hidden
      themselves behind the secrecy of its vows; it is still an undoubted fact
      that <span class="side">FREEMASONRY IN VIENNA, 1781.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p401.png">[401]</a></span> princes like
      Frederick the Great, great and good men like Lessin, Herder, Wieland, and
      Gofethe, have looked upon Freemasonry as a means of attaining their
      highest endeavours after universal good. It will suffice for our present
      purpose to quote a passage from Goethe's funeral oration upon Wieland:<a
      href="#linknote-31004" name="linknoteref-31004" id="linknoteref-31004"> 4
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If any testimony were desired in favour of an association which has
      existed from very ancient days, and has survived many vicissitudes, it
      would be found in the spectacle of a man of genius&mdash;intelligent,
      shrewd, cautious, experienced, and moderate&mdash;seeking his equals among
      the members of our association, feeling himself at one with us, and,
      fastidious as he was, acknowledging our fellowship to be the perfect
      satisfaction of his earthly and social desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wieland himself declared that<a href="#linknote-31005"
      name="linknoteref-31005" id="linknoteref-31005"> 5 </a> the "intellectual
      temple-building" had for its chief and highest object "the earnest,
      energetic, and persevering efforts of every true and honest mason to
      approach nearer himself, and to lead his brethren nearer, to the ideal of
      humanity, and to prove that man is fashioned and appointed to be a living
      stone in the eternal temple of the Almighty."<a href="#linknote-31006"
      name="linknoteref-31006" id="linknoteref-31006"> 6 </a> It was natural
      that in Vienna, where there was more intellectual life than elsewhere, the
      form of secret association should have been utilised in the furtherance of
      these high aims:<a href="#linknote-31007" name="linknoteref-31007"
      id="linknoteref-31007"> 7 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1781 was formed a society of the most distinguished leaders of
      thought in Vienna, under the presidency of the noble and intellectual
      Ignaz von Born. The aim of the society was to give effect to that freedom
      of conscience and thought so happily fostered by the government, and to
      combat superstition and fanaticism in the persons of the monkish orders,
      the main supports of both these evils. Reinhold and the friends of his
      youth, Alxinger, Blumauer, Haschka, Leon and Ratschky, were the most
      zealous members of this association. They <span class="side">MOZART AND
      FREEMASONRY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p402.png">[402]</a></span>
      adopted the forms of Freemasonry as an outward expression of their mental
      and spiritual union. Their lodge was entitled "True Harmony,"<a
      href="#linknote-31008" name="linknoteref-31008" id="linknoteref-31008"> 8
      </a> and, supported indirectly by the favour of the Emperor Joseph, they
      laboured for a considerable time with energy and success to carry out
      their preconceived designs. Their weapons were learning and eloquence, and
      in their use of these, whether in earnest severity or in jesting irony,
      they were more than a match for their opponents.<a href="#linknote-31009"
      name="linknoteref-31009" id="linknoteref-31009"> 9 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this circle, which contained other distinguished men, such as
      Sonnenfels, Retzer, and Gemmingen, proceeded the satires of Born and
      Blumauer against monasticism, which had so extraordinary an effect at the
      time. The scientific organ of the Freemasons was the Vienna
      "Real-zeitung," edited by Blumauer, which endeavoured to drive
      superstition and prejudice from the domain of science in the same
      insidious way in which they had entered it&mdash;Blumauer's principle<a
      href="#linknote-310010" name="linknoteref-310010" id="linknoteref-310010">
      10 </a> being that the work of enlightenment is a very gradual one, and
      that a far harder task than that of learning is the unlearning of what has
      been once hammered into the heads of ordinary mortals. As might have been
      expected, Freemasonry became after a time an affair of fashion in Vienna,
      and many abuses crept in:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of Freemasonry pursued its course with an amount of publicity
      and ostentation almost ludicrous. Freemasons' songs were composed,
      published, and sung everywhere. Their symbols were hung as charms upon
      watch-chains; ladies were presented with white gloves by novices and
      associates, and various articles of fashion were christened <i>Ã  la
      franc-maÃ§on</i>. Many members joined the order from curiosity, or in order
      to enjoy the pleasures of the table. Others had still more interested
      views. It might be of material advantage to belong to a brotherhood which
      had members in every rank, and had made a special point of gaining the
      adhesion of powerful officials, presidents, and members of the government.
      One brother was bound to help another; and those who did not belong to the
      brotherhood were often at a serious disadvantage; this fact enticed many
      to join. Others again, more <span class="side">FREEMASONRY IN VIENNA,
      1785.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p403.png">[403]</a></span>
      sincere or more ignorant, thought they had found a key to higher mysteries&mdash;such
      as the philosopher's stone, or intercourse with disembodied spirits. The
      Freemasons were unquestionably very benevolent; collections for the poor
      brethren were often made at their meetings.<a href="#linknote-310011"
      name="linknoteref-310011" id="linknoteref-310011"> 11 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings against the Illuminati in 1785 led to a commencement of
      persecution of the Freemasons, but on December 11 of the same year the
      Emperor Joseph issued a decree in which, while disclaiming any knowledge
      of the secret vows of the order, or any approval of its juggleries, he
      gave it his countenance upon condition of certain reforms, and placed it
      under the protection of the state.<a href="#linknote-310012"
      name="linknoteref-310012" id="linknoteref-310012"> 12 </a> This decree,
      which was extolled by some as a proof of the highest wisdom and clemency,
      and bewailed by others as the ruin of genuine Freemasonry, gave occasion
      to violent disputes, intensified by the carrying out of the Emperor's
      order for the reduction of the existing eight lodges to three. Born, who
      disapproved of the reform, had, in spite of his previous popularity, to
      suffer numerous personal attacks: An unpleasant encounter with Jos.
      Kratter, nicknamed the "freemason's auto-da-fÃ©," called forth a multitude
      of malignant pamphlets, and in 1786 Bom retired altogether from the lodge.<a
      href="#linknote-310013" name="linknoteref-310013" id="linknoteref-310013">
      13 </a> His loss was a serious one for its intellectual influence, and his
      example was followed by others. The imperial recognition of the lodge did
      not preserve it from increasing attacks and suspicions, which afterwards
      proceeded to publicly expressed disapproval on all sides. But many
      steadfast spirits still held out. Loibl, for instance, placed his dwelling
      at the disposal of the lodge for their meetings. His daughter still
      remembers (1867) how her father spent hours clothed in his robes, sitting
      before a crucifix with lighted tapers, reading the Bible in preparation
      for the sittings, at which the children, peeping through the keyhole,
      wondered to see the gentlemen seated round the table conversing with
      earnest mien. Mozart was among these enthusiasts, and maintained his
      connection with the <span class="side">MOZART AND FREEMASONRY.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p404.png">[404]</a></span> lodge
      until his death; he even conceived the idea of founding a secret society
      of his own&mdash;"The Grotto"&mdash;and drew up rules for its guidance.<a
      href="#linknote-310014" name="linknoteref-310014" id="linknoteref-310014">
      14 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It can scarcely have occurred to Mozart to consider his connection with
      Freemasonry as a means of worldly advancement; such calculations were
      foreign to his nature, and would have been in no degree realised. His
      connection with the order was of no practical advantage to him. The high
      standing of the order when Mozart came to Vienna&mdash;the fact that the
      most distinguished and cultivated men, moving in the best society, were
      counted among its members, renders it natural that he should have desired
      to attach himself to it. His need for intercourse with earnest and
      far-seeing intellects would lead him to the same conclusion. So, too, in a
      still greater degree, would his genuine love for mankind, his warm
      sympathies both in joy and sorrow, his sincere desire to help and benefit
      others, which amounted even to a weakness; and perhaps the greatest
      attraction of all would be the satisfaction of his truly exceptional
      longing for friendship. Even his boyish years are full of instances of
      enthusiastic devotion and attachment&mdash;to young Hagenauer (Vol. I., p.
      50), to Father Johannes at Seeon (Vol. I., p. 58), to Thomas Linley (Vol.
      I., p. 119), and others; and as a man his loving, sympathetic friendship
      was accorded to many, among whom I may remind the reader of Bullinger
      (Vol. I., p. 335)> of Barisani (Vol. I., p. 305), of Gottfried von Jacquin
      (Vol. II., p. 357), of Count Hatzfeld (Vol. II., p. 291). An order which
      made the brotherhood of its members the chief reason of its existence was
      sure to have strong attractions for him, the more so that the spirit of
      independence which he possessed in common with all other gifted natures
      was gratified by the equality of every brother within the circle of his
      <span class="side">INFLUENCE OF FREEMASONRY ON MOZART.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p405.png">[405]</a></span> order. Again,
      the position which he had at that time assumed in relation to the priestly
      and monkish orders gave him a powerful impulse towards Freemasonry.
      Notwithstanding his strict religious training, he had inherited from his
      father a decided aversion to these institutions. L. Mozart writes to his
      daughter (October 14, 1785):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an appalling difference between these sisterhoods and true
      Christianity. It would be an undoubted gain if the nunneries were
      dissolved. They exist neither by virtue of true vocation, nor supernatural
      calling, nor spiritual zeal, nor as the true discipline of devotion and
      abnegation of desires, but are the result of compulsion, hypocrisy,
      dissimulation, and childish folly, leading in the end to confirmed
      wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of his connection with Freemasonry upon Mozart are as plainly
      discernible as his reasons for joining the order. Carefully and well as
      his early training laid the foundation of his after-development, it was
      impossible but that the narrow circumstances of his Salzburg life should
      cramp his intellectual energies; and his visits to great cities, important
      as they were in inciting him to fresh efforts for self-improvement, were
      too transitory to have much practical effect. Earnest endeavours after
      freedom of moral and intellectual development were at that time the
      special characteristic of Freemasonry in Vienna, and the effect must needs
      have been a salutary one which followed the entrance of a young man into a
      circle which busied itself in solving, both theoretically and practically,
      the highest problems of the universe. It would be difficult to say how far
      the secrecy and mystery of the order worked on his imagination and
      attracted him; but some such influence is quite conceivable in a nature so
      artistic and excitable as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mozart was quite in earnest in his fidelity to his order is proved by
      the pains he took to induce his father to become a Freemason. The letter,
      already quoted (Vol. II., p. 323), in which, anticipating his father's
      speedy death, he speaks of the true meaning of death from a mason's point
      of view, bears ample testimony to his earnestness. His lodge <span
      class="side">MOZART AND FREEMASONRY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p406.png">[406]</a></span> recognised it in the oration
      pronounced after his death,<a href="#linknote-310015"
      name="linknoteref-310015" id="linknoteref-310015"> 15 </a> of which the
      passages immediately relating to him may here be quoted:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It has pleased the Almighty Architect of the Universe to take from among
      us our best-beloved and most estimable member. Who did not know, who did
      not respect, who did not love our worthy brother, Mozart? Only a few weeks
      ago he was in our midst celebrating the dedication of our masonic temple
      with entrancing tones. Who of us that saw him then, my brethren, would
      have supposed his days to be numbered? Who would have thought that in
      three weeks we should be mourning his loss? How true it is that man's sad
      destiny often cuts short his career in the very prime of life! Kings
      perish in the midst of their ambitious plans, which go down to posterity
      incomplete. Artists die, after devoting all that was granted them of life
      to the glorification of their art. The admiration of all mankind follows
      them to the grave, nations mourn for them, and yet the universal fate of
      these great men is&mdash;to be forgotten of their admirers. It shall not
      be so with us, my brethren! Mozart's early death is an irreparable loss to
      art. His genius, displayed in earliest childhood, rendered him the wonder
      of his age&mdash;half Europe was at his feet&mdash;the great ones of the
      earth called him their darling&mdash;and we called him&mdash;brother.
      Fitting as it is, however, to call to our remembrance his abilities in his
      art, we must not forget to give our strongest testimony to his excellent
      heart. He was a zealous supporter of our order. The main features of his
      character were brotherly love, devotion to the good cause, benevolence and
      genuine satisfaction in using his talents for the good of his fellows. He
      was estimable alike as husband, father, friend of his friends, brother of
      his brothers; he wanted only wealth to make hundreds happy after his own
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart owed many of his impulses as a composer to his connection with
      Freemasonry. We shall see later that the "Zauberflote" came directly under
      its influence; in this place it will be fitting only to mention those
      compositions which he composed for particular festivities within the
      lodge; they are, of course, exclusively for male voices, and betray in
      other ways enforced compliance with certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Gesellenreise" (468 K.), composed on March 26, 1785, is a social
      song, elevated and pleasing in tone; two others are intended for the
      opening and closing of a lodge (483, 484,K.):<a href="#linknote-310016"
      name="linknoteref-310016" id="linknoteref-310016"> 16 </a> <span
      class="side">MASONIC COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p407.png">[407]</a></span> all three have organ
      accompaniments. The two last conclude with a chorus for two tenors and a
      bass voice. Similar three-part choruses are introduced in other Freemason
      cantatas, and are easy and popular, suitable to amateurs. The tenor solos,
      on the other hand, are adapted to a trained singer, Adamberger, who was a
      member of the lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unfinished cantata (429 K.) was probably intended for some masonic
      purpose. The first chorus, "Dir Seele des Weltalls, Sonne, sei heute das
      erste der festlichen Lieder geweiht," for two tenors and bass, with
      accompaniment for the quartet and flute, clarinet, two oboes and two
      horns, is written out in full for the voices with a figured bass, and the
      accompaniment is sketched in Mozart's usual way. The same is the case with
      the long-drawn-out tenor aria which follows, "Dir danken wir die Freude."
      Only seventeen bars of a second duet for tenor voices, intended as a
      conclusion, are written out. The three-part male chorus, the solos
      exclusively for tenor voices, and the limited orchestra, all suggest
      masonic influence; I will not attempt to give an opinion on the symbolism
      of the words. The first chorus is fine, spirited and solemn.<a
      href="#linknote-310017" name="linknoteref-310017" id="linknoteref-310017">
      17 </a> Two other cantatas certainly fall within this category. The first
      of these is the Maurerfreude (471 K.) composed on April 20, 1785, shortly
      before the departure of his father, in whose presence it was first
      performed. The lodge were giving a banquet in honour of Born, who had been
      highly complimented by the Emperor for his invention of a new kind of
      amalgam.<a href="#linknote-310018" name="linknoteref-310018"
      id="linknoteref-310018"> 18 </a> The cantata, with words by Petran, was
      afterwards published in score, with a title-page engraved by Mansfeld,
      representing "Wisdom and Virtue," as the text says, "addressing themselves
      to their disciple"; it was sold for the benefit of the poor.<a
      href="#linknote-310019" name="linknoteref-310019" id="linknoteref-310019">
      19 </a> The main substance of the work consists of a long <span
      class="side">MOZART AND FREEMASONRY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p408.png">[408]</a></span> tenor solo worked out in free
      form for Adamberger, the first and greater part being after the fashion of
      the allegro of a concert aria. There is nothing of the Italian form in it,
      but deep and genuine feeling is expressed in Mozart's familiar and purely
      German manner. The animation of the expression reaches its climax in a
      recitative leading to a serious and rhythmical song of two verses, the
      concluding lines of which are repeated by the chorus. In the accompaniment
      to this cantata, a clarinet is introduced in addition to the quartet, two

      in July, 1791, is not certainly the immediate result of Mozart's
      connection with Freemasonry, but it is evidently an expression of the
      state of mind which it was the object of Freemasonry to produce.<a

      23 </a> Frz. Hein. Ziegenhagen, a wealthy merchant of Hamburg, incited by
      the study of the Encyclopedists, especially of Rousseau, felt himself
      called upon to take part in the various attempts which were made towards
      the close of the last century to abolish the pedantry of the schools; and
      his efforts to bring education back to a state of natural simplicity were
      more energetic and daring than those of less ardent reformers. He
      published, out of love for humanity and paternal tenderness, as he said,
      an elaborate treatise in which he sought to prove,<a
      href="#linknote-310024" name="linknoteref-310024" id="linknoteref-310024">
      24 </a> by a criticism of the biblical tradition, that existing religions
      could not satisfy the inquirer into the nature of things, and then laid
      down rules for the theoretical and practical education of human beings. He
      hoped, in all seriousness, "to induce wise princes and enlightened
      universities to introduce the study of the relations of things to each
      other, which is so unmistakably superior to ordinary religious teaching;
      and he hoped also to make the acquaintance of such parents as wished to
      devote their children to husbandry and the management of a colony which he
      proposed to found, in accordance with his views, in the neighbourhood of
      Strasburg." In order to render his book attractive from every point of
      view he adorned it with eight copperplate engravings by Chodowiecki, and
      requested Mozart to compose a song to be sung with orchestral
      accompaniment in the meeting-houses of his colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart was certainly not acquainted with the entire <span class="side">MOZART
      AND FREEMASONRY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p410.png">[410]</a></span>
      contents of this eccentric, almost crazy work; Ziegenhagen gave him a few
      general hints of his Utopian scheme, in which he was doubtless perfectly
      sincere, and sent him the words of the hymn. These words emphatically
      express the effort after truth, brotherhood, and happiness which was the
      final object of Freemasonry, and Mozart could not but treat them after the
      same manner that he treated similar poems avowedly masonic. Ziegenhagen's
      lines are so deficient in poetic spirit, and even in poetic metre, that it
      required a more than ordinary amount of genius and cultivation to give
      them the impress of a musical work of art. A work of art this cantata
      undoubtedly is; it is more free in conception than usual, the arie, and
      especially the recitatives, being allowed considerable scope, in order to
      fall in with the unequal and rhetorical words. The union of such an
      accentuation as was necessary to the sense of the words with the full
      expression of warm emotion and the subservience of both to appointed
      musical forms, are the essential features of this composition, and are the
      more likely to strike us, who are so entirely out of sympathy with the
      ideas suggesting the work. A style of music specifically belonging to
      Freemasonry is of course inconceivable; but in the finest passages of
      works such as this, and in the "ZauberflÃ¶te," something is expressed of
      the essence of the masonic character, of <i>moral convictions</i> (I had
      almost said of <i>virtue</i>, but fear to be misunderstood), which appears
      outside the province of music, but which has sometimes been made very
      effective, especially by Beethoven. The "Maurerische Trauermusik bei dem
      Todesfalle der Br. Br. Meklenburg und Esterhazy" (477 K.), composed in
      July, 1785, is an orchestral composition of wonderful beauty and
      originality. The combination of instruments is unusual; besides the
      stringed instruments there are two oboes, one clarinet (only one again),
      three basset-horns, one horn in E flat, one horn in C, and a double
      bassoon.<a href="#linknote-310025" name="linknoteref-310025"

      class="side">MASONIC FUNERAL MUSIC, 1785.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p411.png">[411]</a></span> instruments give a peculiarly
      solemn expression to the work. After a few introductory chords they are
      joined by the strings, and the first violins maintain throughout the same
      character, contrasting with the wind instruments in free rhapsodic
      passages, expressive of grief in all its varied shades. This is most
      striking when a Cantus firmus, following the introduction<a
      href="#linknote-310026" name="linknoteref-310026" id="linknoteref-310026">

    <p>
      is first delivered <i>piano</i> by the oboes and clarinet, and at the
      sixth bar is taken up by the full force of the wind instruments. The
      violins in the meantime have graceful passages, expressive of gentle
      sorrow, which rise to a gradual climax of passionate regret. As this storm
      abates, we are led back to the introductory motif, which prepares the way
      in another climax for the conclusion, preceded by a singularly bold
      harmonic transition of deeply sorrowful expression:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      If we compare the contrapuntal treatment of this Cantus firmus with
      similar works of earlier date, such as the
       <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p412.png">[412]</a></span>
      "Betulia Liberata,"<a href="#linknote-310027" name="linknoteref-310027"
      id="linknoteref-310027"> 27 </a> we are struck with its development of
      technical mastery as well as of depth of sentiment and freedom of
      expression; the same is the case also with the "Zauberflote" and the
      "Requiem." Mozart has written nothing finer than this short adagio in
      technical treatment, sound effects, earnest feeling, and psychological
      truth. It is the musical expression of that manly calm which gives sorrow
      its due, and no more than its due, in the presence of death, and which was
      expressed by Mozart in another form in the letter to his father already
      quoted (Vol. II., p. 323).

      CHAPTER XXXII. MOZART AS AN ARTIST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OF those who realise the excitement <span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p412.png">[412]</a></span>and want of repose of Mozart's life in
      Vienna, and the variety of occupations and distractions which beset him,
      it must appear matter of wonder that he was able to produce so large a
      number of compositions, each bearing an individual character of maturity
      and finish. The wonder increases as the conviction grows that not only was
      he ready as each occasion arose to prove, as Goethe says every artist
      should, that his art came at his command, but that he had the power of
      bringing forth at will his deepest, best conceptions, so that the external
      impulse appeared only as the momentum given to an artistic inspiration. It
      must at the same time be remembered that Mozart was not fond of writing,
      and generally waited until the last moment to give shape to his ideas. He
      was occasionally, therefore, late with his compositions, as with the
      sonata for Strinasacchi (Vol. II., p. 337), or had only time to write the
      parts without scoring them (Vol. II., pp.318, 366), or scarcely allowed
      the copyist time to finish his work (Vol. II., p. 327); it is only
      necessary to look through his Thematic Catalogue to see that most of his
      compositions were written as short a time as possible before they were
      actually wanted. His <span class="side">DISTASTE TO WRITING.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p413.png">[413]</a></span> father, who,
      as a man of business, considered the proper disposition of time as a
      matter of vital importance, often called his son's attention to this
      failing. "If you will examine your conscience closely," he writes
      (December 11, 1777), "you will find that procrastination is your besetting
      sin and when Wolfgang was at work on "Idomeneo" in Munich, he warned him
      "not to procrastinate" (November 18, 1781). After his stay in Vienna,
      convinced that his son was in this respect unchanged for the better, he
      writes to Marianne, on hearing from Wolfgang that he was over head and
      ears at work on the "Nozze di Figaro" (November 11, 1785), "He has
      procrastinated and thrown away his time after his usual habit, until now
      he is forced to set to work in earnest, in compliance with Count
      Rosenberg's commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that Leopold Mozart was right, and that a judicious
      and methodical distribution of time is as desirable in an artist or a
      genius as in any one else; it is true also that perseverance and care may
      enable even an artist to overcome his inclination to procrastination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a glance at the extraordinary fertility of Mozart's genius, at the
      burning zeal and intensity with which he worked, will suffice to show the
      injustice of accusing him of idleness, or of never working unless he was
      actually driven to it. He was perfectly justified in writing to his father
      from Vienna (May 26, 1781): "Believe me, I do not love idleness, but
      rather work." The father's injustice was the result of a want of
      comprehension of the peculiar creative process of his son's genius. He did
      not appreciate the activity and industry of his mind, because it made no
      show, and, indeed, often hid itself behind a careless demeanour; he failed
      to perceive that the disinclination to write generally arose from the
      feeling that the workings of the mind were not yet in a shape to be
      expressed by the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conception of Mozart's work, almost equally mistaken, is that which
      takes as a measure of his genius his wonderfully rapid production, which
      often made his grasp of an artistic idea coincident with his embodiment of
      it in music. The overture to "Don Giovanni" is most often quoted as an
      example of this extraordinary speed. Niemetschek says (p. 84):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p414.png">[414]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart wrote "Don Juan" at Prague in 1787; it was finished, rehearsed, and
      announced for performance in two days' time, before the overture was begun
      to be written. The anxiety of his friends, increasing every hour, appeared
      to entertain him; the more apprehensive they became, the less he would
      consent to hurry himself. It was not until the night before the
      performance, after spending the merriest evening imaginable, that he went
      to his room at near midnight, began to write, and completed the admirable
      masterpiece in a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This very credible account is corroborated by Mozart's wife:<a
      href="#linknote-32001" name="linknoteref-32001" id="linknoteref-32001"> 1
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before the performance of "Don Juan" at Prague, the dress
      rehearsal having already taken place, he said to his wife that he would
      write the overture at night, if she would sit with him and make him some
      punch to keep his spirits up. This she did, and told him tales about
      Aladdin's Lamp, Cinderella, &amp;c., which made him laugh till the tears
      came. But the punch made him sleepy, so that he dozed when she left off,
      and only worked as long as she told tales. At last, the excitement, the
      sleepiness, and the frequent efforts not to doze off, were too much for
      him, and his wife persuaded him to go to sleep on the sofa, promising to
      wake him in an hour. But he slept so soundly that she could not find it in
      her heart to wake him until two hours had passed. It was then five
      o'clock; at seven o'clock the overture was finished and in the hands of
      the copyist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This musical myth has received a stronger colouring in the account of the
      elder Genast, then a young actor at Prague. According to him, Mozart
      partook so freely of the hospitalities of a certain gentleman on the
      evening in question that Genast and a friend brought him home, laid him
      senseless on his bed, and themselves went to sleep on the sofa. On
      awakening, they heard Mozart lustily singing, as he composed his overture,
      and "listened in reverential silence as the immortal ideas developed
      themselves."<a href="#linknote-32002" name="linknoteref-32002"
      id="linknoteref-32002"> 2 </a> A good instance, this, of the way to
      manufacture an anecdote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niemetschek, who had previously remarked with justice that Mozart's work
      was always ready in his head before he sat down to his writing-table, was
      no doubt of the correct opinion that the overture was only written down in
      this haste, not composed. Whether the wife believed this or not <span
      class="side">CONSCIENTIOUS INDUSTRY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p415.png">[415]</a></span> is doubtful, since she adds
      ingenuously: "Some will recognise the dozings and rousings in the music of
      the overture." An evident repetition of some one else's words, and a very
      ingenious idea. One can only say with Hoffman: "Some people are fools!"<a

      An unprejudiced examination soon disposes of the not only foolish but
      detrimental idea<a href="#linknote-32004" name="linknoteref-32004"
      id="linknoteref-32004"> 4 </a> that rapidity of workmanship is a sign of
      true genius; but it is not by any means so easy a task to gain a clear and
      comprehensive insight into the workings of an artist's nature.<a
      href="#linknote-32005" name="linknoteref-32005" id="linknoteref-32005"> 5
      </a> Fortunately for our purpose, however, averse as Mozart was to talk
      much of himself or his compositions, he has left us characteristic traits
      and expressions sufficient to enable us to realise his individualities in
      this respect.<a href="#linknote-32006" name="linknoteref-32006"
      id="linknoteref-32006"> 6 </a>

    <p>
      It is a matter of universal experience that the great men of every art and
      science, who have left any enduring proofs of their genius, have worked
      the more zealously and the more earnestly in proportion as their genius
      surpassed that of other men. That this holds true of Mozart no one who has
      studied his life and works will wish to deny. In his youth, as long as he
      remained under the direct control of his father, his studies were regular
      and severe. And as a man and a fully developed artist he had no ambition
      to be considered one who threw off his compositions with the carelessness
      of genius, or who was ashamed of his honest efforts and labours. His
      dedication of his quartets to Haydn speaks of them as the fruit of long
      and painful labour, and in a conversation with the orchestral conductor
      Kucharz, at Prague, <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p416.png">[416]</a></span> before the
      performance of "Don Giovanni," he expressed himself as follows: "I have
      spared neither labour nor pains to produce something worthy of the
      reputation of Prague. It would be a great mistake to imagine that my art
      is an easy matter to me. I assure you, my dear friend, no one has given
      more trouble to the study of composition than myself. It would not be easy
      to find a celebrated musician whose works I have not often and laboriously
      studied." And in point of fact, the narrator continues, even when he had
      attained to classical perfection, the works of great masters were always
      to be seen lying on his desk.<a href="#linknote-32007"
      name="linknoteref-32007" id="linknoteref-32007"> 7 </a> We have already
      seen how eagerly and with what good result he studied Bach and Handel,
      when once Van Swieten had given him the impetus. Rochlitz<a
      href="#linknote-32008" name="linknoteref-32008" id="linknoteref-32008"> 8
      </a> declares that he was as familiar with the works of Handel as if he
      had been all his life director of the Ancient Concerts in London. He had
      arrived in Leipzig just after arranging "Acis and Galatea" and the
      "Messiah" for Van Swieten, and the impressions of these works were fresh
      upon him. "Handel," Rochlitz heard him say, "knows better than any of us
      what will make an effect; when he chooses he strikes like a thunderbolt."<a
      href="#linknote-32009" name="linknoteref-32009" id="linknoteref-32009"> 9
      </a> He admired not only Handel's choruses, but many of his arie and
      solos, which were not thought much of at that time. "Although he is often
      prosy, after the fashion of his time," said he, "there is always something
      in his music."<a href="#linknote-320010" name="linknoteref-320010"
      id="linknoteref-320010"> 10 </a>

      At Leipzig Mozart became acquainted with the vocal compositions of
      Sebastian Bach. Doles made the St. Thomas choir sing him the wonderful
      eight-part motett, "Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied." His surprise at the
      flow of melody, wave upon wave, passed all bounds; he listened with rapt
      attention, and exclaimed with delight: "That is indeed <span class="side">METHOD
      OF WORKING.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p417.png">[417]</a></span>
      something to take a lesson from!" When he heard that the St. Thomas school
      possessed several other motetts by Bach, he begged to see them, and no
      score being accessible he surrounded himself with the parts, and was
      buried in study until he had worked them all out; then he asked for copies
      of the motetts.<a href="#linknote-320011" name="linknoteref-320011"
      id="linknoteref-320011"> 11 </a> His interest in Benda's monodramas (Vol.
      II., p. 74) and his expressions on the importance of French opera, prove
      that he had profited by the study of living masters; all his works bear
      traces of the kind of influence which is exercised upon a genial and
      receptive nature by the great performances of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a different kind to these general preparatory studies, is that which
      may be properly be called the labour of production: such a technical skill
      and perfection as enables an artist to clothe his ideas in form. It is
      impossible in any art (and more especially so in music) to separate
      absolutely form and substance, and to treat each as a self-sufficing
      element, and equally impossible to divide at any given point the creative,
      inventive force of an artistic production from its formative, executive
      force. The process of production, whether physical or mental, is a mystery
      to mankind; whence and how the artist is inspired as by a lightning flash
      with an idea, he knows himself as little as he can trace in his completed
      work the actual momentum of its conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characteristics of the gradual formation and perfection of artistic
      ideas vary greatly in different artists; even in great and highly
      organised natures the mental powers are variously endowed and developed.
      Statements as to the easy or painful, rapid or deliberate, methods of
      working of different artists, vague and unsatisfactory in themselves, are
      for the most part the result of superficial observation and knowledge. It
      is of little consequence whether an artist at his work is easily
      distracted by external impressions, or whether he pursues his train of
      thought undisturbed by what is going on around him. It is of little
      consequence whether an artist feels necessitated or has made it his habit,
      to regulate his intellectual labours, and to give a written <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p418.png">[418]</a></span> form to every creative impulse,
      or whether he renounces external aids, and shapes, proves, elaborates and
      connects his ideas in his own mind only. That which is of consequence,
      that which no true artist is without, is the power to carry on a train of
      thought from its earliest germs to its full development, unhindered by
      interruptions and distractions; and the further power to realise the idea
      of the whole at every point, as the determining element of the details of
      conception and form. It is difficult to know whether to admire more the
      steady flow of invention and form as it proceeds from some minds, or the
      gradual evolution of a unique self-contained whole out of an apparent
      waste of disconnected ideas which is characteristic of others. Mozart
      displayed from every point of view an exceptionally happy organisation.
      His copious and easily excited productive power was supported by a
      delicate sense of form, which was developed to such perfection by thorough
      and varied study that he employed the technicalities of musical form as if
      by a natural instinct. In addition to this he possessed the gift of so
      detaching his mind from what was going on around him that he could work
      out his ideas even to the minutest detail; his wonderful memory enabling
      him to retain in its completeness whatever he had thus inwardly
      elaborated, and to reproduce it at any moment in a tangible form.
    </p>

      The impulse which drives an artist to production is seldom consciously
      felt by himself and is never capable of definition. In most cases this
      signifies but little, for external impulse usually furnishes only the
      occasion for a work of art, and even when the impulse happens to be a
      visible one our attention is concentrated on the creation which it has
      called forth. This is especially true of music, which draws its immediate
      inspiration neither from nature nor from the world of thought. It would be
      of the highest interest to follow the process by means of which
      impressions made on the artist's mind produce well-defined musical ideas.
      This, however, is impossible; the idea and its musical development are
      simultaneous efforts of the mind; the work of art thus called into being
      cannot be immediately referred to any impulse from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">METHOD OF WORKING.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it by any means essential that it should. It is of far greater
      psychological interest to consider those characteristics of the artist
      which give a clearer insight into his disposition and ways of feeling,
      although it may not be possible to trace them in the details of his works.
      Thus we are told that the sight of beautiful nature stirred Mozart's
      productive powers to activity. Rochlitz writes on Con-stanze's authority:<a
      href="#linknote-320012" name="linknoteref-320012" id="linknoteref-320012">
      12 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was travelling with his wife through beautiful scenery, he used to
      gaze earnestly and in silence on the scene before him; his usually absent
      and thoughtful expression would brighten by degrees, and he would begin to
      sing, or rather to hum, finally breaking out with: "If I could only put
      the subject down on paper!" And, when I sometimes said that he could do so
      if he pleased, he went on: "Yes, of course, all in proper form! What a
      pity it is that one's work must all be hatched in one's own room!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He always endeavoured to pass the summer in the country or where there was
      a garden; it is well known that it was chiefly in a garden that he wrote
      "Don Juan" in Prague and the "ZauberflÃ¶te" in Vienna; and in 1758, having
      taken a country residence for the summer, he wrote to Puchberg (June 27):
      "I have done more in the ten days that I have been here than I should have
      done in two months anywhere else." This love of nature is not surprising
      in a man of Mozart's healthy tone of mind, who had been brought up amid
      the beautiful surroundings of Salzburg. But he was by no means wedded to
      these, or to any other influences from without. Wherever he was he was
      incessantly occupied with musical thoughts and labours. "You know," he
      writes to his father (Vol. II., p. 43), "that I am, so to speak, steeped
      in music&mdash;that it is in my mind the whole day, and that I love to
      dream, to study, to reflect upon it." Those who knew him well could not
      fail to be aware of this. His sister-in-law Sophie describes him well:<a
      href="#linknote-320013" name="linknoteref-320013" id="linknoteref-320013">
      13 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always good-humoured, but thoughtful even in his best moods,
      looking one straight in the face, and always speaking with reflection,
      whether the talk was grave or gay; and yet he seemed always to be carrying
      on a deeper train of thought. Even when he was washing his <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p420.png">[420]</a></span> hands in the morning, he never
      stood still, but walked up and down the room humming, and buried in
      thought. At table he would often twist up a corner of the table-cloth, and
      rub his upper lip with it, without appearing in the least to know what he
      was doing, and he sometimes made extraordinary grimaces with his mouth.
      His hands and feet were in continual motion, and he was always strumming
      on something&mdash;his hat, his watch-fob, the table, the chairs, as if
      they were the clavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karajan tells me that his barber used to relate in after-years how
      difficult it was to dress his hair, since he never would sit still; every
      moment an idea would occur to him, and he would run to the clavier, the
      barber after him, hair-ribbon in hand. We have already observed that
      musical ideas occupied him during all bodily exercises, such as riding,
      bowls, and billiard-playing; his timidity in riding may have arisen from
      the frequent distraction of his attention from the management of his
      horse. General conversation, as Frau Haibl says, did not disturb his
      mental labours, and his brother-in-law Lange was particularly struck by
      the fact that when he was engaged on his most important works he took more
      than his usual share in any light or jesting talk that was going on; this
      resulted from an involuntary impulse to find a counterpoise for his
      intellectual activity. Even when music was going on, provided it did not
      particularly interest him, he had the power of carrying on his own musical
      thoughts, and of ignoring the music he heard, as completely as any other
      disturbance. His elder sister-in-law, Frau Hofer, told Neukomm that
      sometimes at the opera Mozart's friends could tell by the restless
      movements of his hands, by his look, and the way in which he moved his
      lips, as if singing or whistling, that he was entirely engrossed by his
      internal musical activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abstraction and absorption of men of genius appears natural and
      comprehensible, and is respected even by those whose intellectual activity
      is not concentrated in the same way. But few are able to enter into the
      workings of a mind which is ever conceiving and shaping ideas in its
      hidden recesses, without severing its connection with what is going on
      around; such a mind has a sort of double existence, and appears able to
      follow two paths leading in different <span class="side">MENTAL LABOUR AND
      PREOCCUPATION.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p421.png">[421]</a></span>
      directions at the same time. If, as sometimes happens, the outer activity
      fails to keep pace with the inner, a superficial observer possesses
      himself of this fact, and makes it the basis of his judgments, leaving out
      of account the inner and true activity of which the outer is but a
      manifestation. Even Mozart's father failed to comprehend his peculiar
      organisation, and refused to recognise any results of his labour but those
      which were written down, and which had thus, after a long and
      uninterrupted chain of intellectual exertions, received the seal of their
      artistic completion. To Mozart himself, on the contrary, this part of his
      labour seemed unimportant and even burdensome, his productive powers
      having little share in it. He postponed it as long as possible, not only
      because he wished to retain his power over the work which occupied him,
      until it was fully matured in his own mind, but also because he took far
      more pleasure in creating than in transcribing. It cannot be denied that
      he sometimes postponed this least congenial part of his task too long. To
      the methodical man of business this appears all the more blamable, since
      Mozart was always able at need to execute commissions accurately and
      punctually; to speak of idleness, or of forced industry, shows complete
      ignorance of the man. It is true that Mozart laid himself open to the
      imputation by the speed at which he wrote when he actually set to work;
      those who observed this could not conceive why a man with such "gifts of
      Providence" did not "compose," as people say, from morning to night. His
      wife said truly:<a href="#linknote-320014" name="linknoteref-320014"
      id="linknoteref-320014"> 14 </a> "The greater industry of his later years
      was merely apparent, because he wrote down more. He was always working in
      his head, his mind was in constant motion, and one may say that he never
      ceased composing." Although his wife was constantly called on by his
      admirers to urge him to work, she considered it her duty far oftener to
      restrain and moderate his activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful harmony of different artistic qualities in Mozart, which
      Rossini expressed so finely by saying that Mozart was the only musician
      who had as much genius as <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p422.png">[422]</a></span>
      knowledge and as much knowledge as genius, may be traced in many
      particulars. The more subordinate power of grasping the idea of a strange
      composition at a glance, and of executing it on the spot, he possessed as
      a matter of course. His playing at sight has already been noted many times
      (Vol. I., pp. 37, log, 363, 365), and his criticism of Sterkel and Vogler
      show his own view of the matter (Vol. I., p. 387). "It must be," Umlauf
      said, as Mozart writes to his father (October 6, 1782), "that Mozart has
      the devil in his head and his fingers&mdash;he played my opera, which is
      so badly written that even I cannot read it, as if he had composed it
      himself." To this power of seeing at a glance the details and whole
      conception of a musical work was added a marvellous memory, capable of
      retaining all that was so seen. As a boy he gave proof of this by his
      transcription of the Miserere (Vol. I., p. 119); in later years he used to
      play his concertos by heart when he was travelling; not merely one or
      another that he had practised, but any or all; he was known to play a
      concerto from memory that he had not seen for long, because he had
      forgotten to bring the principal part.<a href="#linknote-320015"
      name="linknoteref-320015" id="linknoteref-320015"> 15 </a> At Prague he
      wrote the trumpet and drum parts of the second finale in "Don Juan"
      without a score, brought them himself into the orchestra, and showed the
      performers a place where there would certainly be a mistake, only he could
      not say whether there would be four bars too much or too little; the
      mistake was found just as he had said.<a href="#linknote-320016"
      name="linknoteref-320016" id="linknoteref-320016"> 16 </a> But this proves
      only the power of remembering what was finished and impressed on the mind.
      A more remarkable instance of musical memory was his writing only the
      violin part of a sonata for piano and violin to perform with Strinasacchi
      (Vol. II., p. 337), and playing the piano part from his head without ever
      having heard the piece; or writing a composition at once in parts, without
      having scored it (Vol. II., p. 366). This displays the astonishing
      clearness and precision with which he grasped and retained compositions he
      <span class="side">MENTAL POWERS AND METHOD.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p423.png">[423]</a></span> had once thought out, even in
      their minutest details, and we can now account for the rapidity of his
      transcription from the fact of its being mere transcription. External
      distractions, so far from annoying him, served to divert his mind during
      the mechanical labour with his pen.<a href="#linknote-320017"
      name="linknoteref-320017" id="linknoteref-320017"> 17 </a> He made
      Constanze tell him stories, or played bowls; his wife tells us herself how
      she was confined of her first child while he was composing the second of
      his quartets, dedicated to Haydn (421 K.). This was in the summer of 1783,
      and he sat at work in the same room where she lay; indeed, he generally
      worked in her room during her frequent illnesses. When she complained of
      pain, he would come to her to cheer and console, resuming his writing as
      soon as she was calm. This is a striking proof how unshackled Mozart's
      musical activity was by external circumstances; it is not given to many to
      remain so completely master of their ideas and powers during an event
      which would naturally appeal to the ten-derest feelings of the heart.
      Still more striking is his expression to his sister when he sends her the
      prelude and fugue before mentioned (Vol. II., p. 321). He apologises for
      the prelude being placed improperly after the fugue: "The reason was," he
      says, "that I had already composed the fugue, and wrote it down while I
      was thinking out the prelude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such mental powers as these reduced the mere writing to an almost
      mechanical operation; nevertheless, he did not rely so completely as he
      might have done on his memory, but made occasional notes for his better
      convenience and certainty. Rochlitz tells us, no doubt on Constanze's
      authority:<a href="#linknote-320018" name="linknoteref-320018"
      id="linknoteref-320018"> 18 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart, when in company with his wife or those who put no restraint on
      him, and especially during his frequent carriage journeys, used not only
      to exercise his fancy by the invention of new melodies, but occupied his
      intellect and feeling in arranging and elaborating such melodies, often
      humming or singing aloud, growing red in the face and suffering no
      interruption. The briefest indications in black and white sufficed to
      preserve these studies in his memory; his easily kindled imagination, his
      complete mastery of the resources of his art, and his extraordinary <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p424.png">[424]</a></span> musical memory needed little
      aid; he used to keep scraps of music paper at hand (when travelling, in
      the side-pocket of the carriage) for such fragmentary notes and reminders;<a
      href="#linknote-320019" name="linknoteref-320019" id="linknoteref-320019">
      19 </a> these scraps,carefully preserved in a case, were a sort of journal
      of his travels to him, and the whole proceeding had a sort of sacredness
      to his mind which made him very averse to any interference with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These notes, having served their purpose, seem to have been thought
      unworthy of preservation; the few that remain are interesting and
      suggestive. The sketch which is given in facsimile of Denis's ode (Vol.
      II., p. 370) gives an outline of the whole work in writing so hasty as
      scarcely to be recognised for Mozart's. The voice part is written entire
      as well as the bass of the accompaniment, and the other parts have all
      their characteristics so clearly noted that there could be no doubt as to
      their further elaboration. It is evident that the composition was finished
      in Mozart's brain when the sketch was written, so that it does not appear
      as one attempt among several to give shape to his conception, but as an
      aid to the memory when it should be necessary to write down the whole in
      detail. Similar, but still slighter, is the sketch for one of the songs in
      "L' Oca del Cairo," which is given in facsimile in Jul. AndrÃ©'s edition in
      pianoforte score. Here again the voice part is given from beginning to
      end, but the bass is not shown, and the accompaniment only here and there
      (once with the direction that the clarinets are to be used). The piece was
      simple enough to require very slight reminders for its elaboration. It
      would not be easy to decide whether such a sketch should be considered as
      the result of much previous reflection and study, or whether it was the
      immediate fruit of a moment of inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two sketches never having been elaborated, so far as we are aware,
      we can make no comparison which will show how far such sketches were
      modified before the completion of the work. There is considerable
      difference between the first hasty sketch of the terzet (5) from the
      "Sposo Deluso" (430 K.), which Jul. AndrÃ© has given in the <span
      class="side">SKETCHES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p425.png">[425]</a></span> preface to his pianoforte
      edition, and the later elaboration of it. Nothing remains but the first
      motif&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      but so differently applied that this sketch cannot have been taken as the
      point of departure for the working-out, but must be considered as an
      earlier and rejected conception. On the other hand, the sketches for a
      song from "Idomeneo" (Vol. II., p. 148) and for a tenor song (420 K.) are
      almost identical in the voice part with the score as it stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peculiar interest attaches to Sketch I., given in facsimile. The three
      first lines are noted for a clavier composition; then follows the sketch
      of a terzet (434 K.) for two bass voices and a tenor, from an opera buffa,
      on which Mozart was apparently at work in 1783. A fair copy of the work is
      partially preserved, and gives an idea of the way in which Mozart arranged
      his scores. The sketch contains only the voice parts, with slight hints
      for the accompaniment, showing how in one place the first idea was
      rejected and then again resumed. It is evident from the way in which the
      space is employed that the notes were made very hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The score, on the contrary, is a fair copy of the work accidentally left
      unfinished. It has the proper number of parts for the voices and
      orchestra, with the corresponding title before each. The ritornello is
      first given, which is long, because it serves as an introduction to the
      first scene of the opera. It is formed of motifs which recur later, and it
      is plain that this independent introduction was written after the
      completion of the terzet, in which the motifs have each their special
      signification. The principal parts (first violin and bass), are written in
      full, but only those parts of the wind instruments in which they have
      independent motifs; all that was intended to give colouring and shading to
      this simple outline is omitted. The voice parts are all inserted in proper
      order, and the bass is given in full; but there are few hints for the
      accompaniment. It is all written firmly and neatly, showing plainly enough
      that it was finished. The deviations from the sketch are unimportant <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p426.png">[426]</a></span> in the bass voice, more striking
      in the tenor, where the primary design of the melody remains, but the
      elaboration is modified and the conclusion lengthened. Where the voices
      are together nothing has been altered, so far as we can discover. The
      first sketch breaks off a few bars sooner than the score, which itself is
      a comparatively small fragment of the whole terzet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident, therefore, that the true artistic work was done before the
      first sketch was made, and that the elaboration of the latter into the
      score was no mere mechanical adoption of the motif (which seems to have
      been rejected upon critical revision and, so to speak, bom again), but the
      final reduction to form of what was already complete in conception. This
      is still more the case in the elaboration of the accompaniment in detail;
      the well-defined outline which is given keeps it within certain limits
      without imposing on it any hampering restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further instances may be found in those works of which the plans of the
      scores, generally unelaborated, are preserved. Particularly instructive
      are the unelaborated movements of the Mass in C minor (427 K.) and of the
      "Requiem" (626 K.) in AndrÃ©'s edition; also the pianoforte score of the
      duet (384 K.) from the "EntfÃ¼hrung" and the unfinished opera "L' Oca del
      Cairo," edited by Jul. AndrÃ©, are examples of similar sketches. They
      possess peculiar interest to students, since they show those points which
      Mozart considered as containing the germ of the whole conception. The
      different stages of the elaboration can be traced in most of Mozart's
      autograph scores. The voices and bass are invariably written first, and
      enough of the accompaniment to show its characteristic points; this fact
      can be recognised, even in scores afterwards fully elaborated, by the
      differences in ink and handwriting, which is generally more hasty in the
      elaboration than in the earlier sketch. When once this was made, the
      elaboration was often long deferred; the whole of the first act of "L' Oca
      del Cairo" was thus projected, and, the design of the opera being
      abandoned, was never elaborated; so, too, all the movements of the
      "Requiem," from the Dies irse to the Quam olim were written entire for the
      voices with a figured bass, while the <span class="side">ALTERATIONS AND
      IMPROVEMENTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p427.png">[427]</a></span>
      instrumentation was only suggested. He waited for time and inclination to
      continue the work thus begun, and needed more urging to it than to any
      other, for once having fixed the outline of his design, it required a mere
      mechanical effort to reproduce it in his mind with details of form and
      colour. A striking example is that mentioned on p. 360 (Vol. II.), where,
      by the figuring of the bass, he supplied an aid to his memory of a
      peculiar harmonic succession which perhaps flashed across him at the
      moment of transcription in his compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important alterations were seldom made by Mozart, unless at the instance
      of the singer or the instrumentalist. He sent his father the score of the
      "EntfÃ¼hrung" with the remark that there were many erasures, because the
      score had to be copied at once, and he had therefore given free play to
      his ideas, and then altered and curtailed them before giving the score to
      be written; it is evident from this that the alterations were almost all
      made with reference to external circumstances. The improvements made as
      the work proceeded were usually only trifling, such as modifications in
      pianoforte passages, or unimportant turns of expression in vocal parts.
      Thus, for instance, the close of the Count's song in "Figaro" was
      originally simpler&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p428.png">[428]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the duet for the two girls in "Cosi fan Tutte" (4), Dorabella's part
      had the bars&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      The decided heroic style of the first version, which would be fitting
      enough for Fiordiligi, is thus toned down, and an expression of greater
      elegance given to the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth remarking that the characteristic motif of Donna Anna's song
      in "Don Giovanni"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or sai chi l' o-no- re ra - pi - re a me vol-se, chi fu il tra - di - to
      -re, was originally&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or sai chi l'o-no-re ra - pi - re a me vol-se, chi fu il tra - di - to -
      re, and every one must feel how greatly it has gained by the alteration.
      In every case Mozart's self-criticism has been founded on true feeling and
      discrimination, even when it has not been called for on definite technical
      grounds. In the Countess's song in "Figaro" (19) the first division of the
      allegro, from bar eight, concluded originally thus:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>

      The phrase as it is now known was written underneath and the bass
      scratched out. In the further course of the allegro the three bars&mdash;

      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p429.png">[429]</a></span> were
      originally simply repeated after the interlude, and then went on:&mdash;[See
      Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart appears to have felt when he surveyed the whole song that such an
      untroubled expression of a fresh joyous impulse was not altogether
      appropriate to the character of the Countess, and he therefore inserted
      seven bars on the repetition of the motif, which give the passage an
      altogether different colour:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strongly accented change to C minor expresses such a depth of sorrow
      and yearning pathos that the lively tone of the allegro seems to be
      covered with a veil, and the whole emphasis of the song falls upon this
      place. Certainly, none would have suspected this passage of being an
      interpolation. The concluding bars of the Andante of the C major symphony
      (551 K.) originally ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      How beautifully this passage is replaced by the eleven closing bars, which
      now lead back to the chief theme, and give emphasis and dignity to the
      close! In the terzet from "Tito" (14) the andantino originally closed with
      a simple passage for the strings:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p430.png">[430]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is now replaced by a passage divided among all the instruments&mdash;[See
      Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      which, with its agitated motion, is more sharply characteristic of the
      situation. All these are examples, not of improvements to a finished work,
      but of a free act of production giving a new disposition to the passages
      in their relation to the whole work. But Mozart sometimes hesitated at the
      moment of decision, and made repeated experiments before he was satisfied,
      as in the case of the conclusion of Susanna's charming song in "Figaro,"
      which seems to belong so naturally to its position that one cannot imagine
      it other than it is; yet the sketches and alterations of the original show
      that many earlier experiments were made. Worthy of note also are the two
      bars in the overture to the "Zauberflote" (p. 10, AndrÃ©), in which the
      clarinet leads the repetition of the second subject&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and which Mozart, with just discrimination, has struck out of the finished
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact that Mozart was sometimes uncertain as to his rhythm.
      The quartet in "Cosi fan Tutte" (21) was originally written:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the eighth bar Mozart saw that this was incorrect, and altered the
      first bars&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and continued it so. There is an exactly similar case in the duet in the
      "Zauberflote" (8) which Mozart wrote at first thus&mdash; <span
      class="side">ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p431.png">[431]</a></span> and did not find out his mistake
      until quite the end, when he carefully scratched out all the bar lines and
      put in the correct ones:&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in Sesto's air in "Tito" (19), the adagio originally began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      but the bar lines were afterwards erased and fresh ones supplied in red
      chalk, making the first bar full. Another very singular mistake in the
      duet in the "ZauberflÃ¶te" consists in the omission in the second and third
      bars of the two chords for clarinets and horns, which Mozart has evidently
      merely forgotten to transcribe. Now and then, but very rarely, important
      alterations are made in the instrumentation of his works. One instance
      occurs in the introduction to the "ZauberflÃ¶te," at the beginning of which
      the trumpets and drums were in C, and were so carried on to the entrance
      of the three ladies; then Mozart seems to have thought that trumpets and
      drums could be used with effect as accompaniment, and he has struck
      through all that he had previously written, and noted the trumpets and
      drums upon a loose sheet in E flat; he has then continued them for seven
      bars as an accompaniment to the opening trio. At the beginning of
      Leporello's great songs in "Don Giovanni" (1,4) trumpets and drums were
      indicated, but they were afterwards struck out when it came to be
      performed. In a long comic air, which was intended for "Cosi fan Tutte"
      (584 K.), he has struck out the horn part, after writing the whole of it.
      In Dorabella's air (28) the fundamental bass of those parts where only
      wind instruments are now employed was intrusted to the double-bass; Mozart
      afterwards struck this out, and expressly noted "senza basso." In the
      second finale <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p432.png">[432]</a></span> of the
      "ZauberflÃ¶te" the <i>piano</i> chords which follow Pamina's words, "Ich
      muss ihn sehen" were first given by the strings, but flutes and clarinets
      were afterwards substituted. In the G minor symphony he at first intended
      to have four horns, but after a few bars he struck them out, and limited
      himself to two. In the terzet in the "ZauberflÃ¶te" (20), the first bar of
      the accompaniment was given to the violins, thus&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which was afterwards erased, and a single crotchet used on the unaccented
      part of the bar, with great gain to the effect. But these are solitary
      instances. The individual tone-colouring of the instruments is an
      essential element of musical construction, which cannot be added
      afterwards, but is contemporaneous with the conception, and has its own
      share in the working-out of the musical idea. When, therefore, the
      composer develops his work in his own mind, he hears not only certain
      abstract sounds, but definite individual tones embodied in the voices and
      instruments; the whole image glows with vivid colouring in his mind, and
      only needs to receive its outward form. Besides, it must be remembered
      that Mozart himself created the orchestra as it was employed with
      increasing effect from "Idomeneo" onwards; the full use of wind
      instruments, their combination with each other and with the strings; the
      consequent radical change of colouring in the instrumentation as a whole,
      and the wealth of charming detail in the blending of the tone-colours, are
      all due to Mozart.<a href="#linknote-320020" name="linknoteref-320020"
      id="linknoteref-320020"> 20 </a> He had never heard the effects he strove
      to produce; they existed in the orchestra, it is true, as the statue
      exists in the marble; but just as the sculptor must have seen with his
      spiritual eye what he strives to reproduce in the stone, so Mozart can
      have heard only with his spiritual ear the sounds which he drew from his
      orchestra.<a href="#linknote-320021" name="linknoteref-320021"

      The alterations which have been mentioned are not to be considered as
      selected from among many similar instances, they are the only ones of any
      consequence with which my researches have acquainted me. In forming our
      idea of Mozart's method of writing his score, we may remark further, that
      he did not content himself with such hasty outlines beforehand as might
      suggest the course of the whole by a few touches, but sketched out fully
      those parts where he thought well to give particular attention to the
      details. Canons, fugues, passages in counterpoint, with a complicated
      disposition of parts or some other difficulty, were worked out upon scraps
      of music paper or sheets which had been previously used but not quite
      filled, and then transferred to the score. An accurate sketch for the
      first finale in "Don Giovanni," for instance, where the three dance
      melodies occur together in different measures, was shown to me by Al.
      Fuchs, who had procured one such sketch from each of Mozart's great
      operas. There was another also of the three-part canon in the second
      finale of "Cosi fan Tutte," in which only the canon, not the voice part
      belonging to it, was noted. There exists also, in addition to the rough
      draft of the score of "L' Oca del Cairo," sketches of those parts of the
      quartet (6) and finale (7) which demand particular attention on account of
      the contrapuntal disposition of the parts. Unfortunately but few of these
      sketches have been preserved, but those few show Mozart's method very
      clearly, and leave no doubt that they were made in order that his
      conception might be fully developed and arranged in his own mind before
      its final reduction to writing. They testify, too, of the thoughtfulness
      and deliberation with which he worked, of the severe demands which he made
      upon himself, and the conscientiousness which prevented his trusting to
      the lucky inspiration of the moment or to his own well-tried readiness of
      resource. Our idea of Mozart as an artist is no longer that which has been
      so commonly received and admired, and which shows us a spendthrift of his
      artistic powers, who was only driven by dire necessity to collect the
      fruits which his genius cast unbidden into his lap. The prerogative of
      genius is not a dispensation from labour and painful exertion, but <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p434.png">[434]</a></span> the power of attaining the
      highest aims of such labour, and of obliterating every trace of effort in
      the perfection of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The external characteristics of Mozart's scores show also great care for
      order and clearness. His handwriting was small, but though often rapid,
      and sometimes hasty, always clear, decided, and individual.<a
      href="#linknote-320022" name="linknoteref-320022" id="linknoteref-320022">
      22 </a> The smaller details, in which copyist's errors might easily creep
      in, are specially cared for; all the instructions for delivery are
      carefully given in each part. In short, Mozart's scores leave an
      impression, not of pedantry, which magnifies what is unimportant and loses
      time in an exaggerated regard for method and uniformity, but of a
      well-considered order and careful arrangement of details in their due
      relation to the whole work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admirably illustrative of Mozart's method, as we have endeavoured to
      portray it, are the numerous unfinished compositions of which frequent
      mention has been made; many of these were found after his death,<a
      href="#linknote-320023" name="linknoteref-320023" id="linknoteref-320023">
      23 </a> and some are preserved in the Mozarteum at Salzburg. Among these
      rough draughts of scores are several beginnings of masses belonging to his
      Salzburg days, as also some songs and many unfinished instrumental
      compositions, but by far the greater part were written in Vienna. Among
      them we may note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      6 fragments of string quintets.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 quintets for clarinet and strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 quartet for English horn and strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      9 drafts of violin quartets.
    </p>
    <p>
      9 drafts of pianoforte concertos.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 pianoforte quartet.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 drafts of pianoforte trios.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 sonata for pianoforte and violoncello.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 sonatas for pianoforte and violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 movements for two pianofortes.
    </p>
    <p>
      9 movements for the pianoforte.!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      These are none of them roughly sketched drafts, but fair copies of
      unfinished scores, the completion of which was prevented by outward
      circumstances. Again we meet with <span class="side">UNFINISHED
      COMPOSITIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p435.png">[435]</a></span>
      confirmation of the fact that Mozart never began to write until his
      composition was in all essential points completed in his own mind. When
      only a few bars are written they offer a perfected melody, a motif only
      requiring its further development. When the sketches are longer they form
      a well-rounded, continuous whole, that is evidently interrupted, not
      because the continuation is not ready to hand, but because some chance has
      prevented its further transcription. It may be plainly discerned also that
      not only are detached ideas put into shape, but the different
      characteristic traits of execution are indicated in the usual way, so that
      the chief effects and capabilities of the motifs may be clearly inferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears as if Mozart, when once interrupted in the transcription of a
      composition, was very loth to return to it again. That he might have done
      so cannot for a moment be doubted. His memory was infallible; but his
      interest was concentrated on the work with which he was concerned at the
      moment. He was easily impelled to write what he had already completed in
      his head, and this led him naturally to the next piece of work; to return
      to what he considered as over and done with was contrary to his nature and
      habit. There is no reason whatever to suppose that any of these sketches,
      preliminary notes, or unfinished compositions were ever subsequently made
      use of. This not only testifies of the wealth and ease of his
      productivity, which scorned to borrow even from himself, but it proves
      that his creations proceeded immediately from spontaneous impulses, each
      having independent birth, and owing its development to the singular
      fecundity of his artistic nature. The individual truth and fresh life of
      Mozart's works are founded in this natural spring of ever-welling
      spontaneity. Their artistic perfection rests on the skill with which the
      conception is developed; but in what consists the peculiar charm and
      beauty which is acknowledged and enjoyed by us all as inseparable from
      Mozart's music is, and will ever remain, an unsolved mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      However carefully Mozart, as a rule, prepared his compositions before
      writing them, we, who are acquainted with his nature and education, can
      scarcely doubt that he was <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p436.png">[436]</a></span> able on
      occasion to compose as he wrote. Such a song as that which he wrote in the
      tavern for Frau von Keess cannot well have been ready in his head. When he
      was in Prague at the beginning of 1787 he promised Count Joh. Pachta to
      write a country dance for a public ball, but failed to produce it. At last
      the Count invited him to dinner an hour earlier than his usual time, and
      when Mozart appeared placed all the requisite materials before him, and
      entreated him to compose the dance on the spot, seeing that it was
      required for the following day. Mozart set to work, and before dinner had
      composed nine country dances, scored for full orchestra (510 K), which he
      certainly had not prepared beforehand.<a href="#linknote-320024"
      name="linknoteref-320024" id="linknoteref-320024"> 24 </a> These and
      similar instances refer to easy pieces in free form; but we have already
      seen (Vol. II., p. 366), that he could improvise canons and double canons
      of an unusual kind; and what further proof can be required than reference
      to his marvellous gift of executive improvisation?
    </p>
    <p>
      In composing Mozart never had recourse to improvisation. "He never came to
      the clavier when he was writing." says Niemetschek (p. 82); "his
      imagination pictured the whole work when he had once conceived it." His
      wife also says naÃ¯vely, but graphically: "He never composed at the
      clavier, but wrote music like letters, and never tried a movement until it
      was finished."<a href="#linknote-320025" name="linknoteref-320025"
      id="linknoteref-320025"> 25 </a> When his compositions were completed he
      used to rehearse them, singing or playing, with his wife or any one else
      who happened to come in. Kelly narrates that Mozart greeted him one
      evening with, "I have just written a little duet for 'Figaro.' You shall
      hear it." He sat down at the pianoforte, and they sang it together; it was
      the duet (16) "Crudel perchÃ© finora"; and Kelly often remembered with keen
      delight how he had first heard and sung this charming composition.<a
      href="#linknote-320026" name="linknoteref-320026" id="linknoteref-320026">

    </p>
    <p>
      In one sense, it is true, Mozart felt the necessity for an external vent
      to his musical ideas; and for this he had frequent recourse to his own
      special instrument, the clavier or pianoforte. "Even in his later years,"
      says Niemetschek (p. 83), "he often spent half the night at the piano'<a
      href="#linknote-320027" name="linknoteref-320027" id="linknoteref-320027">
      27 </a> these were the hours that witnessed the birth of his divinest
      melodies. In the silent calm of night, when there was nothing to distract
      the mind, his imagination was kindled into supernatural activity, and
      revealed the wealth of melodious sound which lay dormant in his nature. At
      such times Mozart was all emotion and music, and unearthly harmonies
      flowed from his fingers! Only those who heard him then could know the
      depth and extent of his musical genius; his spirit, freed from every
      impediment, spread its bold pinions, and soared into the regions of art."
      It could scarcely fail to be the case that in such hours as these the
      subject of his improvisation should often be the work of which his mind
      was full at the time; but it would be a mistake to consider the
      improvisation as an express preparation for a subsequent work, or as the
      actual source from which it sprang. The improvisation was the embodiment
      of the mood of the moment, its form and extent were limited by the
      conditions of the instrument on which it was played, and it could by no
      means serve as an immediate foundation to a work to be performed under
      entirely different conditions and with a definite object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart carefully separated his time for writing and his time for
      improvising. To the end of his life he kept to his early habit of writing
      in the morning (Vol. II., p. 208), and even when he had been out the
      evening before, or had played far into the night, he was accustomed to
      begin work at six or seven o'clock; in later days, however, he indulged
      himself by writing in bed. After ten he usually gave lessons, and never
      returned to the writing-table unless there were urgent occasion. Such
      occasion arose often enough, it is <span class="side">MOZART AS AN ARTIST.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p438.png">[438]</a></span> true.
      When he was composing "Figaro," his father tells Marianne (November 11,
      1785) how he postponed all his pupils until the afternoon, so as to have
      the whole morning free for writing, and we have already seen that he
      sometimes wrote in the evening, and even at night. Mozart's marvellous
      improvisations were not confined to hours of solitude and calm, nor to the
      satisfaction of his inner cravings; he showed himself equally master of
      the art when the impulse came from without, as was frequently the case,
      for people loved to hear him improvise. There is a peculiar charm in this
      accomplishment which, while it at once identifies the artist with his
      creation, requires the highest concentration of artistic energy to satisfy
      the varied conditions on which the production of a work of art depends.
      The improvising musician and his audience act and react upon each other;
      the latter receive the direct impression of the artist's individuality and
      power, and feel themselves, as it were, let into the secret of his method
      of producing the works which delight them, while the former is inspired to
      fresh efforts of genius by his consciousness of possessing the sympathy of
      his hearers. Mozart was always ready to play when he thought he should
      give pleasure, but he improvised in his best vein only "when he spied out
      among the crowd surrounding him one or more of the privileged few who were
      capable of following the flights of his genius; oblivious of all others,
      he addressed the elect in the hieroglyphics of his art, and poured forth
      for them alone his richest streams of melody."<a href="#linknote-320028"
      name="linknoteref-320028" id="linknoteref-320028"> 28 </a> We have much
      contemporary testimony as to the impression made by Mozart's improvising.
      Ambros Rieder, who died in 1851 at eighty years of age in Perch-tolsdorf&mdash;an
      enthusiastic musician and a worthy man&mdash;writes in his
      "Recollections";<a href="#linknote-320029" name="linknoteref-320029"

      youth I had opportunities of hearing and admiring many distinguished
      virtuosi, both on the violin and the harpsichord; but I cannot describe my
      amazement and delight in hearing the great and immortal W. A. Mozart play
      variations and improvise on the pianoforte before a numerous and
      aristocratic audience. It was to me like the gift of new senses of sight
      and hearing. The bold flights of his imagination into the highest regions,
      and again down to the very depths of the abyss, caused the greatest
      masters of music to be lost in amazement and delight. I still, in my old
      age, seem to hear the echo of these heavenly harmonies, and I go to my
      grave with the full conviction that there can never be another Mozart.<a

      And Niemetschek, when an old man, said to Al. Fuchs: "If I dared to pray
      the Almighty to grant me one more earthly joy it would be that I might
      once again hear Mozart improvise; those who have not heard him can form no
      idea of his extraordinary performances."<a href="#linknote-320031"
      name="linknoteref-320031" id="linknoteref-320031"> 31 </a> Repeated
      mention has already been made of Mozart's readiness and skill in playing
      "out of his head," as he used to call it (Vol. I., pp. 385-386). He
      avoided the common error of improvising virtuosi in the introduction of
      long cadenzas, "making a hash in the cadenza of what had sounded well
      enough in the concerto," as Dittersdorf says (Selbstbiogr., p. 47). A new
      fashion came into vogue about this time; instead of a long cadenza, a
      simple theme was delivered, and then varied according to every rule of the
      art; but Mozart used also frequently to improvise a free fantasia in his
      concertos (Vol. II., p. 285). Rochlitz narrates<a href="#linknote-320032"
      name="linknoteref-320032" id="linknoteref-320032"> 32 </a> how at Leipzig
      the audience wished to hear him alone at the close of one of his concerts,
      and though he had already played two concertos and an obbligato scena, and
      accompanied for nearly two hours&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at once, and played to the delight of all. He began simply and
      seriously in C minor&mdash;but it is absurd to attempt to describe it. As
      he was playing with special reference to the connoisseurs who were
      present, he brought the flights of his fancy lower and lower, and closed
      with the published variations on "Je suis Lindor." (Vol. II., p. 174).

      Stiepanek, writing of the concert which Mozart gave in Prague (February,
      1787), says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the concert Mozart improvised on the pianoforte for a good
      half-hour, and raised the enthusiasm of the delighted Bohemians to its
      highest pitch, so that he was obliged to resume his place at the
      instrument in compliance with their storm of applause. His second stream
      of improvisation had a still more powerful effect, and the audience again
      tumultuously recalled him. Their enthusiasm seemed to inspire him, and he
      played as he had never played before, till all at once the deathlike
      silence of the listeners was broken by a voice from among them exclaiming,
      "Aus 'Figaro'!" whereupon Mozart dashed into the favourite air, "Non piÃ¹
      andrai," and improvised a dozen of the most interesting and artistic
      variations upon it, ending his wonderful performance amid a deafening
      storm of applause.<a href="#linknote-320033" name="linknoteref-320033"
      id="linknoteref-320033"> 33 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Niemetschek also speaks of this concert (p. 40):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweet enchantment seized upon us in listening to Mozart's improvisation
      on the pianoforte, which he continued for more than half an hour, and we
      gave vent to our delight in a perfect storm of applause. His playing
      surpassed anything that could be imagined, uniting all the qualities of
      first-rate composition and perfect ease of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such moments of inspiration as this gave his countenance an expression
      which betrayed the artist within him.<a href="#linknote-320034"
      name="linknoteref-320034" id="linknoteref-320034"> 34 </a> At other times,
      his appearance was in no way striking or distinguished. His head was
      somewhat too large in proportion to his body; his face was pale, though
      not unpleasing, but in no way uncommon, and the Mozart family nose
      asserted itself very plainly as long as he continued to be thin. His eyes
      were tolerably large and well shaped, with good eyelashes and bushy brows,
      but they were not bright, and his look was absent and restless. He had a
      great dislike to hearing his appearance commented on as insignificant
      (Vol. I., p. 381), and was seriously angry once when the Prussian
      ambassador gave him a letter of introduction, in which he said that he
      hoped Mozart's insignificant personal appearance would cause no prejudice
      against him.<a href="#linknote-320035" name="linknoteref-320035"
      id="linknoteref-320035"> 35 </a> "This absent creature," says the notice
      in Schlichtegroll's "Nekrolog," "became another being as soon as he sat
      down to the piano. <span class="pagenum">
      <a href="pgimages/p441.png">[441]</a></span> His spirit
      seemed to soar upwards, and his whole mind was absorbed in what seemed the
      proper object of his being, the harmony of sound." "His whole countenance
      would change," says Niemetschek, "his eye became calm and collected;
      emotion spoke from every movement of his muscles, and was communicated by
      a sort of intuitive sympathy to his audience."

    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE can be
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p441.png">[441]</a></span> no reason
      to doubt what has often been asserted and
      maintained with proof, that Mozart was the greatest pianoforte-player of
      his time. Although, however, the fame of a virtuoso among his
      contemporaries is more brilliant and universal than that of a composer,
      yet posterity can form but a vague idea of the performances which were so
      enchanting to the hearers. It is impossible to give an accurate or very
      intelligible account of Mozart's playing, but it will not be without
      interest to note such of its characteristic features as are still within
      our grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had small, well-shaped hands," says Niemetschek (p. 66), "and moved
      them so gently and naturally over the keys, that the eyes of his hearers
      were charmed no less than their ears." Like most pianoforte-players, his
      hands used involuntarily to assume the position they would have had in
      playing. The notice in Schlichtegroll's "Nekrolog" even observes that
      constant practising had rendered his hands awkward in ordinary use, and
      that it was only with extreme difficulty that he could cut up his meat at
      table!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was wonderful that he could do so much with them, particularly in
      left-hand stretches. A great deal of his perfection must be ascribed to
      the admirable fingering, which according to his own acknowledgment he owed
      to a diligent study of Bach's works."<a href="#linknote-33001"
      name="linknoteref-33001" id="linknoteref-33001"> 1 </a> Mozart certainly
      appears to have played Bach's clavier music from a very early age (in his

      href="pgimages/p442.png">[442]</a></span> letters to Breitkopf the father
      frequently orders Bach's last compositions); and once at a party at
      Doles', when the conversation fell upon Bach's playing, Mozart declared:
      "He is the father; we are the lads. Those of us who can do anything owe it
      to him; and whoever does not admit that is a &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."<a

    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's criticisms on the playing of Nanette Stein (Vol. I., p. 361) and
      Vogler (Vol. I., p. 387) prove the value he attached to good fingering as
      the foundation of firm and expressive execution. It is well known that Ph.
      Em. Bach's<a href="#linknote-33003" name="linknoteref-33003"
      id="linknoteref-33003"> 3 </a> practical development of his father's
      principles<a href="#linknote-33004" name="linknoteref-33004"
      id="linknoteref-33004"> 4 </a> laid the foundation of the present system
      of the art of fingering, and it is equally certain that Mozart, and with
      and after him Clementi, were the first to tread in the path so marked out.<a
      href="#linknote-33005" name="linknoteref-33005" id="linknoteref-33005"> 5
      </a> He insisted mainly that the player should have a "quiet, steady
      hand," the natural ease, flexibility, and smooth rapidity of which should
      be so cultivated that the passages should "flow like oil" (Vol. I., p.
      361); he did not counsel the practice of <i>tours de force</i> which might
      be prejudicial to these qualities. His first requirements were the
      delivery of "every note, turn, &amp;c., correctly and decidedly, and with
      appropriate expression and taste" (Vol. I., p. 387). He cautions players
      against over-rapidity of execution, not only of passages where the harmony
      is strictly connected, but also of those where offences against strict
      time seem more allowable. He was strongly opposed to violations of time.<a
      href="#linknote-33006" name="linknoteref-33006" id="linknoteref-33006"> 6
      </a>He believed (Vol. I., <span class="side">MOZART AS A VIRTUOSO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p443.png">[443]</a></span> p. 361)
      that Nanette Stein would never acquire the power of playing in time,
      because she had not been accustomed to it from childhood. His own playing
      always excited admiration from his accurate time, never giving way to a <i>tempo
      rubato</i> in the left hand, while at the same time playing with perfect
      expression and deep feeling&mdash;and without making grimaces, to which he
      had a great aversion (Vol. I., p. 361).
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed correctness first in the list of qualities essential to
      first-rate playing, and included among them ease and certainty in the
      execution of unusual technical difficulties, delicacy and good taste in
      delivery, and, above all, that power of breathing life and emotion into
      the music and of so expressing its meaning as to place the performer for
      the moment on a level with the creator of the work before him. We must be
      content to accept the enthusiastic testimony of the public, of
      connoisseurs, and of accomplished fellow-artists,<a href="#linknote-33007"
      name="linknoteref-33007" id="linknoteref-33007"> 7 </a> who all agreed
      that Mozart indisputably ranked highest among virtuosi, by virtue of his
      fulfilment of all these conditions.<a href="#linknote-33008"
      name="linknoteref-33008" id="linknoteref-33008"> 8 </a> When we find
      Clementi declaring that he never heard any one play so intellectually and
      gracefully as Mozart, Dittersdorf finding art and fine taste united in his
      playing, and Haydn asserting with tears in his eyes that he could never
      forget Mozart's playing, because it came "from the heart" (Vol. II., p.
      350), the simple expressions of such men are more eloquent than the most
      emphatic hyperbole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The union in Mozart of the virtuoso and the composer caused his
      performances as a virtuoso to be more directly influenced by his
      compositions than was usually the case. His pianoforte compositions have
      left us only an imperfect image of these combined accomplishments, partly
      because <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p444.png">[444]</a></span> the living
      breath of genius cannot be reproduced, partly because the greater number
      of these works were written under the influence of external circumstances,
      which denied free scope both to the composer and the performer.<a
      href="#linknote-33009" name="linknoteref-33009" id="linknoteref-33009"> 9
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Variations upon a well-known theme were at that time a favourite form of
      improvisation, so much so that varying and improvising were terms often
      used synonymously.<a href="#linknote-330010" name="linknoteref-330010"
      id="linknoteref-330010"> 10 </a> It is easy to understand the interest
      which even a less educated public took in this form. A simple theme,
      either familiar or of a kind to be easily understood, gives the hearers
      something to be laid hold of, and it amuses them to recognise and follow
      the air in its manifold disguises. The regular development and elaboration
      of a motif, obliging constant attention from the hearers in order to trace
      the connection of its different parts, was not expected in these
      fashionable variations. What was looked for was such a prominence given to
      some characteristic elements of the subject (whether in the harmonic
      succession, in the rhythm or the melody) as should serve constantly to
      suggest it to the mind, while affording a basis for a free play of musical
      fancy. Such variations on a given subject may be in some measure compared
      with arabesque and similar ornamentations in architecture, which display
      complex and fantastic varieties of animal and vegetable forms, but behind
      their apparent irregularities maintain a constant reference to the
      constructive design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart never cultivated any other than this easy style of variation; and
      we find a contemporary critic expressing the wish that he would write,
      "not only these florid variations, but others in the style of the two
      Bachs, with scientific inversions and imitations, and in counterpoint."<a
      href="#linknote-330011" name="linknoteref-330011" id="linknoteref-330011">
      11 </a> But amateurs were fond of the easier form, and he found frequent
      occasion to write variations for his pupils or other friends. He did not
      care about them himself, and took no pains to have them published. But
      finding favour with <span class="side">PIANOFORTE VARIATIONS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p445.png">[445]</a></span> the public,
      they were eagerly sought after and published,<a href="#linknote-330012"
      name="linknoteref-330012" id="linknoteref-330012"> 12 </a> often with many
      inaccuracies; nor were all genuine that appeared under the name of Mozart.<a
      href="#linknote-330013" name="linknoteref-330013" id="linknoteref-330013">
      13 </a> The following variations belong to the Vienna period, and probably
      to the year 1784:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. "Unser dummer PÃ¶bel," from Gluck's "Pilgrims of Mecca" (Vol. II., p.
      285, 455 K.)
    </p>
    <p>
      2. "Come un agnello," from Sarti's "Fra Due Litiganti" (Vol. II., p. 345,
      460 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1785 were composed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      3. September 12 (500 K.)
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Duet, November 4 (501 K.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Then follow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "Upon a Minuet by Dupont," composed April 9, 1789 (573 K.)
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding," from the second part of the "Two
      Antonios," by Schikaneder, composed March 8, 1791 (613 K.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The following were announced in 1785, but some of them certainly belong to
      an earlier date:<a href="#linknote-330014" name="linknoteref-330014"

    </p>
    <p>
      7. "Lison dormoit" (264 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "La Belle FranÃ§oise" (353 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "Salve tu Domine," from Paesiello's "Eingebildete Philosoph" (398 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "La BergÃ¨re SilimÃ¨ne," with violin (359 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "HÃ¨las, j'ai perdu mon amant," with violin (360 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1786:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      12. "Marche des Manages Samnites," by GrÃ©try (352 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1787:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "Ah, vous dirais-je maman?" (265 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these, even the more pretentious of them, there is no appearance of
      a higher object than passing amusement, secured by means of the contrast
      of the different variations in time and measure, major and minor,
      prominence of the right hand or the left, with all of which devices we are
      now so over-familiar. It never occurred to Mozart to give a deeper meaning
      to his variations by the grouping of the movements, nor still less to
      torture a simple theme into all sorts of fantastic forms. He confined
      himself to a tasteful embellishment of the subject; harmonic and
      contrapuntal treatment was not altogether absent, but it was little more
      than suggested as a sort of seasoning to the music. In many of the earlier
      variations mechanical difficulties are brought into the foreground.
      Certain favourite difficulties, such as the passing over of the hands,
      long shakes or chains of shakes in one hand, while the other has the
      subject, were always to be found; passages which now offer neither novelty
      nor difficulty display nevertheless, upon closer inspection, both elegance
      and originality. The equal use made of the two hands is worthy of remark;
      a considerable amount of execution in the left hand is presupposed in
      these as in most of Mozart's compositions. In the later variations (3, 5,
      6, 17) there is little or no bravura. The theme is easily and gracefully
      treated; and no attempt is made to invest with undue dignity what is
      merely a light and passing expression of fancy. As one of the most
      interesting and successful compositions of this kind may be mentioned the
      four-handed variations (4), which are both graceful and amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">SHORT PIANOFORTE PIECES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p447.png">[447]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes variations form a component part (the middle or last movement)
      of a sonata, either with<a href="#linknote-330015"
      name="linknoteref-330015" id="linknoteref-330015"> 15 </a> or without
      accompaniment (284, 331, K.). This has caused no essential difference in
      their treatment; they are neither wider in conception nor freer in
      execution, nor are they connected by intermediate passages so as to form
      one whole&mdash;a device often and successfully employed by Haydn and
      Beethoven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's original themes are, for the most part, fresher and more graceful
      than those he has borrowed. The accompanied sonatas give greater scope for
      originality by the multiplication of the parts; and very often the simple
      enunciation of the theme by one of the parts allows a better defined
      expression of free contrapuntal treatment to be given to it by the other
      parts. But, as we have said, these modifications are unimportant; the form
      of the variation is here, as elsewhere, simply light and entertaining.<a
      href="#linknote-330016" name="linknoteref-330016" id="linknoteref-330016">
      16 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Various short pianoforte pieces, for particular occasions and persons,
      were written during Mozart's Vienna period, as, for instance, the three
      rondos:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In D major, composed January 10, 1786 (485 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In F major, composed June 10, 1786 (494 K.).<a href="#linknote-330017"
      name="linknoteref-330017" id="linknoteref-330017"> 17 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In A minor, composed March 11, 1787 (511 K.).<a href="#linknote-330018"
      name="linknoteref-330018" id="linknoteref-330018"> 18 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two in F and D major are easy of comprehension and execution&mdash;cheerful,
      but not striking music; the latter is peculiar in that the oft-repeated
      theme recurs in different keys, thus necessitating changing modulations in
      the episodes.<a href="#linknote-330019" name="linknoteref-330019"
      id="linknoteref-330019"> 19 </a> The third, in A minor, is very original
      and beautiful.<a href="#linknote-330020" name="linknoteref-330020"
      id="linknoteref-330020"> 20 </a> The theme is somewhat piquant in its
      rhythm and harmonic treatment, and suggestive of a national melody&mdash;
      <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p448.png">[448]</a></span> a mode of characterisation not
      often used either by Mozart or Beethoven. Its original modifications cause
      fresh surprise each time that it recurs. The second theme, effective by
      contrast with the first, is in itself both fine and expressive, and gives
      occasion for much appropriate and interesting treatment. The short middle
      movement, in A major, is lighter in style, but accords well with the chief
      theme, and leads back to it by a striking modulation. The whole piece is
      original in character; and the tone of melancholy which runs through it
      and constantly asserts itself forms a most attractive contrast to the
      restless movement of some of its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short Adagio in B minor (540 K.) (composed March 9, 1788) is also very
      beautiful, serious and even sad in tone, and otherwise interesting by
      reason of its harmonic inflections. Although this piece is written in
      perfectly regular form, in two parts with a coda, it reminds us in its
      whole style of an improvisation. This is still more the case with the
      so-called fantasias. It has already been remarked that preludes or
      fantasias were often prefixed as introductions to various kinds of
      compositions, either in the form of free improvisations or elaborate
      pieces that could be used on different occasions. A fantasia of this kind,
      prefixed to the beautiful fugue in C major, has already (Vol. II., p. 391)
      been noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart sent to his sister from Paris (July 20,1778) a short prelude, "not
      a prelude to lead from one key to another, but a sort of capriccio, to try
      the clavier," leaving the style of playing to her own judgment. "She
      received it at four o'clock," writes the father (August 13, 1778), "and at
      five, when I came home, she said she had thought of something, and if I
      liked it, she would write it down. She then began to play the prelude by
      heart. I rubbed my eyes and said: 'Where the deuce did you get that idea?'
      She laughed and drew your letter from her pocket." This is, no doubt, the
      unpublished prelude in C major (395 K.) which was in the possession of
      Mozart's sister. The essential character of this, as of the prelude in C
      minor (396 K.), is modulatory. There is no delivery of a regular melody,
      or working out of a definite motif, but the whole consists of varied and
      <span class="side">FANTASIAS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p449.png">[449]</a></span> skilfully grouped passages and
      arpeggios, keeping both hands in equal activity, and displaying an
      abundance of rapid and often curious and striking changes of harmony. But
      even in this apparently unfettered straying through harmonies we cannot
      fail to be aware of organisation in the succession of the modulations, in
      the connection of the passages, and in the whole conception. The C major
      is in several detached contrasting movements, the C minor is founded on
      the definite form of a two-part sonata movement, but very freely treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fantasia in D minor(337 K.&mdash;>(397 K. DW)) is of somewhat
      different design, in so far that the melodic element is more prominent,
      but at first only in oft-repeated phrases, which are continually prevented
      from developing into a perfect cantilene by the occurrence of a
      contrasting motif, or the outbreak of a quick stormy passage. The
      character of a gradual concentration of force is very clearly expressed.
      The tender and graceful theme which is at last allowed to assume its due
      proportions, can, however, be in no way considered as the proper result of
      such a preparation; it is not worked out, but first interrupted, and then
      brought to a rapid but not a satisfying conclusion, so maintaining the
      character of the piece as an announcement of something greater which was
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The well-known fantasia in C minor (475 K.), Mozart's performance of which
      so surprised Jos. Frank (Vol. II., p. 279),<a href="#linknote-330021"
      name="linknoteref-330021" id="linknoteref-330021"> 21 </a> is better
      worked out, and in every respect a more important work. Five movements, in
      various keys and tempos, are closely bound together into a whole by
      connecting passages or harmonic inflections. Each movement, though not
      completely separate, has yet a certain independence, with melodies of its
      own rounded into a simple song-like form; there is no attempt at the
      elaboration, or even the full development, of a motif, but everything
      presses onwards, each section leading as of necessity to the next, which
      is intended to form a lively contrast to what has preceded it. In spite of
      the <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p450.png">[450]</a></span> predominance
      of a slow tempo, the whole work has a restless character, and the
      recurrence at the end of the serious and sustained commencement leads only
      to a provisional and unsatisfying conclusion. Here again, the essence of
      the fantasia is modulatory. The changes of harmony are frequent&mdash;often
      bar by bar&mdash;rapid and striking; the passages and even the melodies
      are so constructed as to lend themselves to this method. In spite of its
      length the fantasia preserves the character of an introduction, though not
      of necessity to the sonata with which it is printed. The mood which is so
      distinctly expressed in the two first bars of the adagio is preserved
      throughout the fantasia; it is a sad and sorrowful mood of doubting and
      questioning, of struggling and striving, of longing for deliverance from a
      heavy burden, for freedom from doubt and care; disheartened by failure,
      unrefreshed by consolation, it sinks at last into itself, and is heard no
      more. But there is no hopeless despair, no cynical irony in this music. It
      is expressive throughout of the composure of a man who even in combat
      never loses command over himself. The boldness of its harmonies, and the
      consistency of its tone were of unusual significance at the time of its
      composition. It is much to be regretted that the letter concerning it,
      which Mozart addressed to Frau von Trattnern (Vol. II., p. 279), has not
      been preserved.<a href="#linknote-330022" name="linknoteref-330022"

    </p>
    <p>
      Above and beyond such detached movements as these, the form of pianoforte
      composition chiefly cultivated by Mozart was the sonata, either with or
      without the accompaniment of one or more instruments.<a
      href="#linknote-330023" name="linknoteref-330023" id="linknoteref-330023">
      23 </a> The foundation of the sonata proper, and of the definite form in
      which the chief movement of the sonata, at least, was cast&mdash;was laid
      by Kuhnau and Dom. Scarlatti, the latter of whom brought his extraordinary
      technical knowledge to bear with effect on the treatment and style of
      pianoforte music. From the middle of the last century the piano as a solo
      instrument has been increasing in favour, especially among amateurs, and
      it <span class="side">THE PIANOFORTE SONATA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p451.png">[451]</a></span> naturally followed that this
      species of composition should be cultivated with corresponding attention.
      Ph. Em. Bach and his disciple Jos. Haydn fixed the form of the sonata in
      all essential respects, and by the intrinsic worth of their compositions,
      and the charm of their execution, brought the germ of perfection therein
      contained to the point of vital development. To them succeeded Mozart,
      carrying on their work in his own original manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has already been demonstrated (Vol. I., p. 292) that the clavier sonata
      in its free development forms the basis of independent instrumental
      composition, and that every advance in the one direction acts favourably
      in the other; it will suffice here, therefore, to touch briefly on the
      main points of this species of composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sonata now signifies a composition for a solo instrument, consisting
      of several movements, differing in time, measure, and key, but
      sufficiently allied in design and grouping to form a coherent whole. In
      its earlier stage two movements often composed a sonata, but afterwards
      three or four became the rule. One of the movements is in slow time, and
      forms the appropriate expression of a calm, serious, or tender mood. It
      soon became usual to place this movement in the middle, with the
      instinctive feeling that a composed and self-concentrated mood ought to
      succeeed to a demonstrative or passionate one. If the more animated
      movement were preceded by the slow one, the latter would lose its
      independent character, and become a mere introduction to the former. The
      second of the lively movements served as a conclusion, and was invariably
      cheerful, sometimes even merry in tone. The music being principally
      intended for social entertainment, was so constructed as to leave a
      pleasant, cheerful impression. When a fourth movement was added it was
      generally in the same tone, and sometimes preceded, but more often
      followed, the slow movement. During his Vienna period Mozart's sonatas,
      both solo and accompanied, have but three movements, while his symphonies,
      quintets, and quartets are always furnished with minuets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three movements of the sonata have only gradually <span class="side">MOZART'S
      PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p452.png">[452]</a></span>
      assumed their present form. One of Mozart's earlier sonatas, in A major
      (331 K), consists of an andante with variations, a minuet, and rondo;
      another, in D major (284 K.), has a middle movement, consisting of a rondo
      <i>en polonaise</i>, followed by a theme with variations. Afterwards,
      however, he adhered to the regular sonata form, with the first movement as
      its most characteristic part, forming the point of departure for the
      development of all modern instrumental music. It has already been remarked
      that the essential elements of the sonata movement consist in the
      treatment of the principal motif in the first part, and in its working out
      in the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrapuntal elaboration of a theme in strict form was the groundwork
      of the first part, and was followed by the characteristic treatment of
      well-defined motifs, side by side with a free use of figures and passages.
      An important point was the delivery of a second theme, independent of the
      first and sharply distinguished from it. This was always in the dominant
      of the principal major key (C major&mdash;G major), or in the relative
      major of the principal minor key (C minor&mdash;E flat major). These are
      the two main pillars of the movement. Their further development, their
      connection by means of interludes, and the conclusion of the part, are not
      further hampered by rule, except that the part must close in the dominant.
      The province of the second part was the working out of one or more motifs
      employed in the first part, or altogether new. The treatment was either
      mainly harmonic or mainly thematic, and had for its object the organic
      development of the given elements, the enhancing of the interest, and the
      effective return to the first part. Upon this elaboration, and leading
      back to the first theme, were concentrated all the power and genius of the
      master. The repetition of the first part entailed many modifications,
      partly because the second theme was obliged to appear in the principal key
      in which the movement closed; it allowed also of alterations in grouping
      the different phrases, of amplifications or curtailments, and especially
      of such a long-drawn climax at the close as should almost entitle the
      repeated second part to be considered as a third part.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart found these elements ready to hand, and gave them the stamp of his
      own individual nature. In his hands the second subject, distinctly
      enunciated, became not only an independent but a counter-subject rising in
      characteristic relief from the body of the part. But his originality is
      principally displayed in the formation of the themes. Their predominant
      characteristic is songlike melody, which NÃ¤geli (Vorlesungen Ã¼h. Musik, p.
      156), with a mistaken view of the nature of instrumental music, considered
      to be the degradation and ruin of pianoforte-playing. With truer judgment
      Mozart has followed the injunctions of Ph. Em. Bach, and after him Haydn,
      and has striven to write melodiously. Mozart's musical training was
      founded on song&mdash;and his inclinations led him to song&mdash;in a
      greater degree than was the case with his two predecessors. When once' the
      pianoforte composer had renounced the severe polyphonic method&mdash;when
      once he had come to regard his theme not as material for pedantic
      elaboration, but as a free melody capable of giving expression to his
      artistic perceptions, then song became the point of departure for all his
      melodies. A transference to the instrument of the forms expressly
      constructed for the voice was impracticable; they could only be employed
      by analogy, in conformity with the nature of the instrument. Mozart never
      employed the form of the Italian cantilene in his pianoforte compositions,
      nor in his instrumental works generally; a glance at his Italian operas
      will show the difference in the treatment of the melodies. Wherever a
      comparison of instrumental with vocal works is possible, it must be made
      with the German operas, especially with the "ZauberflÃ¶te." In his
      instrumental works Mozart gave his emotions their natural expression
      without binding himself to any such set forms as those of Italian opera;
      with equal freedom he treated song in his German operas as the immediate
      outcome of his feelings. The developed forms of German instrumental music
      suggested this treatment. The essential conditions of a beautiful melody,
      founded on the relations of intervals, rhythm and harmonies, were
      perfectly fulfilled in Mozart's pianoforte compositions. Each melody is
      complete, uniform and full of his own charm of grace and <span class="side">MOZART'S
      PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p454.png">[454]</a></span>
      euphony. The delivery of such melodies must have given special prominence
      to those qualities in Mozart's playing which Haydn declared came from his
      heart; we are sometimes surprised in the concertos, for instance, to find
      the chief effect depending on a long, simply sustained melody, which he
      must have played in masterly fashion. This songlike and expressive
      treatment of the separate melodies was accompanied by an extraordinary
      wealth of melody. Instead of the connecting phrases which generally led
      out of the principal motif or were formed by free passages, Mozart
      introduced new melodies. This was made an occasion of reproach to him, as
      Dittersdorf says ("Selbstbiographie," p. 237): "Mozart is unquestionably a
      great original genius, and I know of no composer who possesses such an
      astonishing wealth of ideas. I only wish he were a little less prodigal of
      them. He gives his hearers no time to breathe; as soon as one beautiful
      idea is grasped, it is succeeded by another and a finer one, which drives
      the first from the mind; and so it goes on, until at the end not one of
      these beauties remains in the memory." We shall certainly not echo this
      complaint of Mozart's prodigality of ideas; but it cannot be denied that
      though the formation of independent melodies is an important and necessary
      step in advance, it does not reach the last stage of development. Mozart's
      melodies are not strung together without connection, both external and
      internal; but, in the shorter sonatas especially, where they are not
      worked out, they strike us as the indicated points in a design wanting as
      yet the detail of which it is capable.<a href="#linknote-330024"
      name="linknoteref-330024" id="linknoteref-330024"> 24 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The gain was important in two respects. The close juxtaposition of
      melodies excluded, or greatly limited, the employment of connecting
      passages without sense or meaning. Of these Mozart makes comparatively
      little use. He used figures and passages chiefly as ornaments, and not as
      independent members of the movement. But where this form of transition
      seemed inevitable, he used it without ceremony, just as in architecture
      supports are worked into the artistic design, <span class="side">SONATAS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p455.png">[455]</a></span> without
      any disguise of their structional importance. We may instance the broad
      and expressive treatment of his closes and half-closes, which are now so
      striking as to appear to many a special peculiarity of Mozart's style.
      This, however, they are not; they were then in general use, and proceeded
      from the desire to maintain the key with firmness and decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater freedom of modern music in this respect, and the substitution
      of graceful and original transition phrases for dry commonplaces is an
      undoubted progress. Mozart's transition phrases were, however, often elegant
      and interesting, as may be proved from a reference to his returns to the
      theme in the second parts, and to the varied development which he gives to
      the simple ground form of the organ point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second respect in which Mozart's method was a gain to music was in the
      clearness which it gave to his designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This clearness is an inseparable adjunct of Mozart's art; by means of it
      the main points of his structure were as clearly defined as an
      architectural ground-plan, and became the supports for elaboration and
      development. Mozart himself was far from exhausting the resources of the
      method which he founded; others have followed in his footsteps, and
      Beethoven, his intellectual heir, has displayed all the depth and wealth
      of that which he has inherited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the choice and arrangement of his melodies Mozart invariably displays
      delicate taste and discrimination. He is particularly happy in surprising
      his hearers with a new melody when they least expect it&mdash;at the close
      of the first theme, for instance, which generally brings with it a certain
      sense of satisfied completeness. But his most inimitable effect is
      produced when, just as the movement is drawing to a close, a perfect
      melody starts up in all its charm of fresh sweetness, reviving the
      interest of the hearers, and often giving an entirely new turn to the
      whole. As a striking example,
    </p>
    <p>
      I may remind my readers of the first movement of the Symphony in C major
      (551 K.). Who has not been charmed again and again by the last melody,
      which, like a shining meteor, sheds light and cheerfulness around?
      Similar, though not perhaps equally brilliant, effects are of constant
      occurrence; they have not been achieved, have scarcely even <span
      class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p456.png">[456]</a></span> been attempted by any other
      musician. On the other hand, however, the partiality with which Mozart has
      treated the close and other less prominent points of his movements has
      been prejudicial to the so-called second subject; this is usually the
      weakest part. It should have a light and tender character, in contrast to
      the principal subject; it is frequently, however, insignificant in
      comparison to the other motifs, and gives the impression of having been
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The further development of the fundamental scheme was accomplished by
      means not of the insertion of phrases connecting its principal members,
      but of the thematic treatment of these members themselves. Mozart's study
      of Bach and Handel led him in this direction, as was particularly shown in
      his later pianoforte works; an interesting example is afforded by the two
      movements in the Allegro and Andante in F major (553 K.), which are
      throughout in counterpoint. This work must not be considered as a relapse
      into the strict forms of counterpoint, such as the canon and the fugue,
      but as the free development of the laws to which polyphonic and
      contrapuntal forms are alike subject. Instrumental and especially
      pianoforte music, freed from the fetters of strict form, was in danger of
      advancing exclusively in the direction of homophonie development, and so
      becoming insipid. It is Mozart's merit to have brought polyphonic and
      thematic treatment, modified according to the altered character of the
      music and the nature of the instrument, to its freest and most beautiful
      expression. This is particularly noticeable in the "working-out" divisions
      of the movements, on which the main emphasis must necessarily fall, and
      which can only attain their full significance by means of this treatment.
      Mozart does not indeed develop them in length and breadth as Beethoven
      does, but he makes them, even when they are so condensed as to appear mere
      transition movements, the culminating point of the whole movement, the
      concentration of all its force and action. The mode of treatment is as
      free as the choice of subject; but the effect generally depends upon a
      thematic treatment which is often very artistically designed and woven
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that the harmonic element is neglected&mdash;the boldest <span
      class="side">SONATAS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p457.png">[457]</a></span> and most original modulations
      occur in the very places where close examination discloses the thematic as
      the vivifying element, the true impulse of the work. This free and
      intellectual treatment of the polyphonic method was distasteful to many of
      Mozart's contemporaries, who only accepted the traditional forms of
      counterpoint. Thus, a critic expresses himself as follows concerning the E
      flat sonata for violin and piano (481 K.):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasing style of this sonata by Herr M. will cause it to find favour
      with all lovers of the art. It is to be wished, however, that Herr M.
      would attach himself less closely to the passing taste of the day; his
      works would thereby gain a more universal and lasting worth. That Herr
      Mozart is not wanting either in the knowledge of harmony or the wealth of
      imagination which would enable him to offer us stronger meats is
      sufficiently vouched for by this and many other of his well-known works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same critic considered the working-out movement far too long:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although musical science has no actual rule in such cases, yet a
      difference of three pages is out of all reason.<a href="#linknote-330025"

    </p>
    <p>
      The slow middle movement and the last movement have not the accurate and
      well-defined form of the first. Two essentially easier forms are mainly
      employed, with many modifications, namely, variations and the rondo. The
      slow movement is, as a rule, founded upon the song form, and is therefore
      often designed in two parts; but the design is only very seldom developed
      as broadly and fully as in the first movement; the repetition of the theme
      more than once, with the then customary additions and embellishments,<a
      href="#linknote-330026" name="linknoteref-330026" id="linknoteref-330026">
      26 </a> led naturally to the adoption of variations. But in every case the
      first requirement was the composition of a movement melodious in form and
      substance, and owing its expression not to its connection with any other,
      but to its own intrinsic <span class="side">MOZART S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p458.png">[458]</a></span>
      feeling. The tone of sentiment then existing was favourable to the
      production of just such movements, and they therefore undoubtedly belong
      to Mozart's finest creations. These simple and expressive melodies,
      exquisitely formed and firmly handled, full of warm and deep emotion or of
      sentimental tenderness, seem to be the precious legacy of the time to
      which we also owe the purest strains of our lyric poetry. The calm with
      which they are for the most part permeated expresses in a rare degree the
      enjoyment and satisfaction of artistic activity. The very ease with which
      these movements are constructed, by means of the development of the main
      idea of variations on it and of freely treated and often contrasting
      secondary parts, shows how freely and naturally they proceeded from the
      heart of the musician. As an instance of detail we need only mention the
      delicacy and grace with which Mozart leads up to the conclusion, and
      leaves his hearers with a parting impression of perfect satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last movements are not by any means of equal merit with the other two.
      A large majority are in the easy rondo or variation form. The incredible
      ease with which Mozart poured forth melodies is more than ever apparent in
      these movements, but they are often loosely strung together without
      development, and sometimes trivial in character. The original intention of
      the movement, of enlivening the audience by a cheerful dance or something
      similar, is generally kept in view; the tone is one of more or less
      excited merriment, without depth or true humour. Mozart's enjoyment of
      dances, games, and jests of all kinds found expression in such
      performances as these. Their purity and grace of form shows however that,
      like a true artist, he lifts every manifestation of his nature into a
      higher sphere. Many of his last movements form exceptions to what has been
      said above, both by reason of their stricter form and of their more
      elevated tone.

      surpass all previous efforts, and point to what Beethoven was to achieve

      Pianoforte music for two performers was then far from having attained the
      popularity which it now possesses, especially among amateurs. Those who
      wished to play for the sake of playing, and to give full effect to their
      performance, would not readily shackle themselves with a fellow-performer,
      and lose their absolute sway over the instrument. Duets were considered an
      exceptional kind of amusement, not without its peculiar charm. This charm
      consisted in the richer elaboration of material which they allowed, and in
      such a division and alternation of the parts as should set the <span
      class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p460.png">[460]</a></span> two players in competition.
      Mozart, who excelled in this kind of treatment, often employed it, and
      even transfers entire cantilene with their accompaniments to the bass
      part, not always, as Marx rightly observes ("Lehre von der Musikalischen
      Composition," III., p. 601), with a good sound effect. Of the two great
      sonatas, that in F major is by far the most striking; the emphasis is not
      here laid upon the first movement. The adagio, and still more the rondo,
      are specially interesting from their beautiful motifs and the seriousness&mdash;even
      to grandeur&mdash;of their treatment. The other Sonata in C major is not
      trivial in conception, but depends more upon brilliant execution, and
      leaves a cheerful, pleasant impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compositions for two pianofortes were more popular, as affording more
      scope for display to the performer, but the inconvenience attending their
      performance has prevented the cultivation of this branch of composition.
      It appears at one time to have been a favourite one with Mozart, owing, no
      doubt, to some special circumstances. The Fugue in C minor (426 K., Vol.
      II., p. 392) was composed on December 29,1783, and the Sonata in D major
      (448 K.) at the beginning of 1784; the latter is a capital bravura piece
      for the time at which it was written, effective even now, and interesting
      from the interweaving of the two parts. The first movement is the best,
      the working-out forcible and effective, though not elaborate; the andante
      is somewhat tedious, owing to the repetition of the entire first part.
      Several commencements now among the sketches in the Salzburg Mozarteum
      fall within this perio.d. A second fugue, in G major (45 Anh. K.), has
      already been noticed (Vol. II., p.388); the commencements of an Allegro in
      C minor (44 Anh. K.) and of an Adagio in D minor (35 Anh. K.) are so grand
      and forcible as to cause regret that they were not continued; a last
      movement in B flat major (43 Anh. K.) is calmer and more cheerful in
      character. It is remarkable how these few bars confirm the observation
      that the choice of a minor key was with Mozart an invariable sign of a
      special effort of his productive powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sonatas with violin accompaniment composed by Mozart in Vienna were
      few in number. The first collection <span class="side">SONATAS FOR
      PIANOFORTE AND VIOLIN.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p461.png">[461]</a></span> which appeared in November, 1781
      (Vol. II., p. 187), Six Sonatas, Op. 2 (376, 296, 377-380, K.), in F, C,
      F, B flat, G, E flat major, comprise some sonatas written at an earlier
      date&mdash;those in C and B flat major undoubtedly were, both upon
      external and internal evidence. That they were all intended for one
      collection is evidenced by the differences in their designs, probably for
      the sake of variety. Thus, the Sonata in C major begins with an elaborate
      Adagio leading into the Allegro in G minor (in depth of feeling these are
      the finest movements in the set); the last movement is in variations. In
      the Sonata in F major, variations are placed in the middle, and the last
      movement is a tempo di minuetto, treated rondo fashion. The first movement
      is especially prominent in the Sonatas in F major and E flat major. A
      Sonata in C major begun in 1782, "Pour ma trÃ¨s chÃ¨re Ã©pouse" (404 K.), is
      unfinished. The fragment of a Sonata in A major, with an introductory
      Andante, followed by a Fugue in A minor (402 K.), only half worked-out,
      and completed by Stadler, belongs unquestionably to the period of Mozart's
      intercourse with Van Swieten. These were followed by:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      B flat major, composed April 21,1784, for Strinasacchi (Vol. II., p. 336),
      (454 K.).

    </p>
    <p>
      F major, "Short Violin Sonata for Beginners," composed July 10, 1788 (547
      K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater number of these were composed for pupils. The majority of
      amateur pianists were then ladies, and it was usual for them to be
      accompanied on the violin by their teachers or other friends; this kind of
      music found favour also in social reunions.<a href="#linknote-330030"
      name="linknoteref-330030" id="linknoteref-330030"> 30 </a> It follows,
      therefore, that these sonatas have no great depth of passion or scholarly
      treatment, but are well supplied with beautiful melodies and startling
      harmonic inflections, and are made interesting, sometimes even brilliant,
      to please the performers. A notice of the first six sonatas soon after
      their appearance says:&mdash;<a href="#linknote-330031"
      name="linknoteref-330031" id="linknoteref-330031"> 31 </a>

      <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

    </p>
    <p>
      These sonatas are unique of their kind; rich in new ideas and signs of the
      genius of their author, very brilliant and well suited to the instrument.
      Besides this, the violin accompaniment is so artistically combined with
      the pianoforte part that both instruments are kept in constant activity,
      and the sonatas require a violin-player of equal skill with the pianist.
      But it is impossible to give a full description of this very original
      work. The connoisseur must play it through for himself, and he will then
      be ready to acknowledge that we have not exaggerated its merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears from this that the violin part was usually treated as
      subordinate, exclusively intended for accompaniment; but not so with
      Mozart: his violin parts are completely independent, on an equality with
      the piano, and composed with special reference to the idiosyncrasies of
      the instrument. Indeed, the whole design of these sonatas avoids any
      interweaving of the parts, which are generally in strict counterpoint;
      even the simple form of imitation is comparatively seldom employed; the
      parts relieve one another, exchange melodies and passages, or move freely
      together. If, however, we compare the violin part so skilfully added to
      the Sonata in B flat major (570 K.), we shall find that it is no essential
      part of the design, but an evident addition; while in the violin sonatas
      proper, simple as the violin part may be, it cannot be subtracted without
      injury. The principal charm of these sonatas lies in the rich development
      of their harmonies. In this respect, too, the later sonatas are, as usual,
      superior to the earlier. With the exception of the short sonata for
      beginners (547 K.), that in E flat major (481 K.) is the easiest, but it
      is remarkably clear and pretty. The working-out of the first movement is
      formed by the delicate harmonising of the favourite subject already known
      to us (Vol. I., p. 259)&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which recurs free in the second part, and is therefore judiciously used to
      bring the whole movement to a close. In the B flat major sonata also (454
      K.) the interest of the working-out is essentially harmonic; the return to
      the first subject is as striking to those who hear it now as it could have
      <span class="side">PIANOFORTE TRIOS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p463.png">[463]</a></span> been to Mozart's contemporaries.
      There are many similar touches which suffice to convince us how great an
      effect of novelty and boldness these sonatas must have produced. The first
      place must again be accorded to the slow middle movements by reason of
      their beautiful melodies, in the steady flow of which the art of not
      merely beginning well, but of maintaining the interest, and knowing where
      to leave off, may be admired and studied. In all of them a delicate and
      tasteful accompaniment, a rich and bold harmonic treatment&mdash;I need
      only mention the effective enharmonic changes in the andante of the B flat
      major sonata (454 K.), and in the adagio of the E flat major (481 K.)&mdash;give
      to the simple outlines a delicate warmth of colour. Each of these
      movements is fine of its kind, but the andante of the Sonata in A major
      (526 K.) is specially attractive from the earnestness of its tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same class may be reckoned the trios, or, as Mozart called them,
      terzets for piano, violin, and violoncello, which were also principally
      intended for the social circle of amateurs. Their composition for special
      occasions may be inferred from the fact that they all five fall within the
      summer and autumn of 1786 and 1788:&mdash;

      In June of the latter year Mozart asked his friend Puchberg if he did not
      intend to give a musical party soon, for he had written a new trio. This
      was the trio in E major; and a later distinct mention of a trio written
      for Puchberg probably refers to the same. There can at least be no
      question as to the superiority of this trio in design and originality, as
      well as in the effective treatment of the instruments. The first movement
      is full of fire and energy, the imitative working-out of the second
      subject being <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p464.png">[464]</a></span> wonderfully
      heightened in effect by a bold harmonic inflection. The second movement,
      with something of the character of a national melody, is fresh and
      charming, and has rhythmic and harmonic points which give it a piquancy
      altogether modern. The last movement, though not devoid of expression and
      delicacy, is inferior in vital energy to the first, and seems somewhat too
      long, perhaps because an exclusive attention to brilliancy loses its
      effect upon hearers of our day. External influences account for the fact
      that the succession of the trios is not in accordance with their merit and
      importance. The two last are inferior not only to that just mentioned, but
      also to the two first. In these, as usual, the middle movements stand
      highest; in the first movement of the trio in B flat major (2) there is no
      new second subject, but the first is employed again with some
      modification; the second part, therefore, opens with an entirely new and
      independent melody. The trio in C major (548 K.) is very easy, and seems
      to have been intended for some particular person. The last (564 K.) was
      first written by Mozart as a sonata for pianoforte alone. When he had
      occasion to add the two stringed instruments, he had the original
      composition copied, added the violin and violoncello parts, and altered
      what had to be altered for the piano. The original sonata may be easily
      traced, except here and there, where the alterations have gone deeper, and
      the different instruments, except in the variations, have little
      independence. In contrast with the emancipation of the violin part in the
      violin sonatas, the violoncello part of the trios is always in the
      background. It is treated as a bass instrument, and only exceptionally
      leads the melody or takes an independent part; of bravura it has little or
      none, and thus the original effects of which the combined instruments are
      capable seldom occur. One remarkable instance of such an effect, however,
      is in the last movement of the first trio (496 K.) at the passage in G
      minor, where the violin repeats four times the melancholy bar&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      and then slides on to the G, while the violoncello carries out <span
      class="side">TRIO FOR PIANOFORTE, CLARINET, AND VIOLA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p465.png">[465]</a></span> an expressive
      bass passage in crotchets, and the piano in two parts moves above both
      instruments in quavers; an effect of sound and motif which has often been
      laid claim to in recent days as something new and original. An
      insurmountable obstacle to the fuller development of the trio (in which
      Beethoven later put forth all his creative powers) consisted in the want
      of good violoncellists among the musical circles for whom Mozart composed
      these works.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trio in E flat major, for pianoforte, clarinet, and viola (498 K.),
      composed on August 5, 1786, for Franziska von Jacquin, is very original
      (Vol. II., p. 278). The unusual combination of instruments necessitated
      unusual treatment. The viola is not a bass instrument, and is only
      available for middle parts, so that the usual violoncello part could not
      be given to it; this necessitated an altogether original design and
      execution, and a dependence for effect upon a peculiarly light colouring
      and transparent clearness. The viola, whether accompanying or leading the
      melody, is treated throughout with special partiality, and has even a
      certain amount of bravura. Mozart was fond of taking the viola himself in
      his later years, and Franziska von Jacquin was an excellent pianiste, so
      that we can understand his providing himself with a good part to perform
      with his friends. The deeper tones of the clarinet are not used, out of
      consideration to the viola; its full liquid tones are particularly well
      adapted for the delivery of the melody. The plan of the movements deviates
      from the ordinary course. The first is not an Allegro, but an Andante 6-8
      (signifying formerly a moderately agitated tempo) which is played straight
      through with no repetition of the first part. It is in three tolerably
      equal divisions, in each of which the two beautiful subjects are enlarged
      upon in an easy but attractive manner, the first of them especially&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      being scarcely ever lost sight of; the movement ends with a short coda.
      The second movement is a minuet, the only one of the kind in Mozart's
      pianoforte pieces, serious and <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE
      MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p466.png">[466]</a></span>
      broad in tone, somewhat elaborated in the trio, the motif of which is
      taken up in the coda; on the whole, a fine and characteristic movement.
      The concluding rondo is full of pretty melodies and brilliant passages,
      and the different parts are delicately and independently treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A relatively much higher rank than that of the majority of the trios is
      taken by the two quartets for pianoforte, violin, viola and violoncello,
      of which the first, in G minor (478 K.), was composed on October 19, 1785;
      the second, in E flat major, on June 3, 1786 (493 K.). They are, suitably
      to their enlarged resources, grander and broader in design, the motifs are
      fuller, and thematic treatment comes to the foreground. The details of the
      work are developed from within, and are made subservient to the plan-of
      the whole. Notwithstanding, therefore, their more elaborate treatment, the
      mode of expression is more definite, the contents weightier, the
      expression more forcible and clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inclination of the present day, since Beethoven has raised chamber
      music both in substance and form to a hitherto unapproachable height, is
      to make beauty of form<a href="#linknote-330034" name="linknoteref-330034"
      id="linknoteref-330034"> 34 </a> predominate over force and depth of
      original expression; it will be instructive, therefore, to cast a glance
      over a criticism by Rochlitz, written in the year 1800:<a

      In these compositions, written for a select and limited circle, the spirit
      of the artist is displayed after a rare and singular manner, with the
      grandeur and sublimity of an appearance from another world; there are
      moments, it is true, of melting sadness or cheerful humour, but they are
      only moments, and the composer breaks forth again in the greatness, even
      fierceness, of his strength, or writhes in bitter sorrow&mdash;the
      struggle ending, as it were, only in victory or death. That this may not
      be taken for mere empty raving, let any one hear, well-executed&mdash;(which
      can only be by persons who possess, together with the requisite skill,
      both a heart and an understanding for music)&mdash;Mozart's quartet for

      As an illustration of passionate feeling, amounting even to harshness in
      the force of its expression, we should rather quote the first movement of
      the quartet in G minor. The following account from Vienna of "the latest
      musical novelties at grand concerts," written in 1788, will give some idea
      of the reception which these quartets met with on their first appearance,
      and of the difficulties they presented to contemporary performers:<a

      The favourite pianoforte composer among lady amateurs is Kozeluch, but
      Pleyel is beginning to be a dangerous rival to him. Pleyel's music
      contains humour and more of original invention than Kozeluch's, although
      the latter possesses elegance, regularity of form, and a certain flow of
      ideas. Mozart is at present residing in Vienna as imperial kapellmeister.
      He is considered as a remarkable man by every philosophic lover of music.
      His genius was precocious, and he both composed and played in his eleventh
      year (even earlier) to the admiration of all who heard him. But what is
      truly remarkable is that this precocious child should have blossomed into
      maturity as an accomplished musician. We know the usual rapid course of
      such a prodigy by sad experience! We look in vain for its fruits, for its
      stability. Not so with Mozart! But now a few words on a curious phenomenon
      which he (or his celebrity) has brought to pass. A short time ago appeared
      a solitary quartet (for piano, violin, viola, and violoncello), very
      artistically arranged, requiring extreme accuracy of delivery in all the
      four parts, but even under the most favourable circumstances not likely to
      please any but musical connoisseurs in a <i>musica di camera</i>. The
      report, "Mozart has written a new and very remarkable quartet, and such or
      such a princess possesses it and plays it!" was soon spread abroad,
      excited curiosity, and caused the indiscretion of the production of this
      original composition at a grand noisy concert. Many pieces can sustain
      their reputation even under a mediocre performance; but this work of
      Mozart's in the hands of indifferent amateurs, carelessly rendered, is
      simply unendurable. It was so performed innumerable times last winter; at
      almost every place which I visited I was taken to a concert, and there
      entered a town-bred miss, or some other conceited amateur, to play this
      quartet to the noisy company who pretended to find it the <i>goÃ»t</i>. But
      it gave no real pleasure; every one gaped with <i>ennui</i> at the long <i>tintamarre</i>
      of four instruments who did not keep together for four bars, and whose
      contradictory <i>concentu</i> gave no impression of unity of sentiment.
      The obstinacy with which it was forced down everywhere was indescribable.
      It is not enough to stigmatise this folly as an ephemeral <i>manie du jour</i>
      for <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p468.png">[468]</a></span> it lasted
      throughout a whole winter, and (as far as I can learn) is still only too
      often repeated. What a contrast if this masterpiece were to be performed
      by four skilful musicians, in a quiet room where the listening ear might
      catch the suspension of every note, in the presence of only two or three
      attentive listeners! But this would give no opportunity for display or the
      applause of the vulgar.<a href="#linknote-330037" name="linknoteref-330037"

      The quintet in E flat major (452 K.) for pianoforte, oboe, clarinet, horn,
      and bassoon is a composition of peculiarly charming effect; it was
      composed by Mozart on March 30, 1784, for a concert which he gave in the
      theatre, and, being excellently performed, was received with great
      applause. He himself considered it, as he tells his father (Vol. II., p.
      287), to be the best thing he had ever written, and he selected it to play
      before Paesiello (Vol. II., p. 279). It must not be judged from the
      various arrangements which have been made of it; it is accurately and
      exclusively fitted for the instruments for which it was written. The sound
      effects produced by the well-considered combinations of the wind
      instruments are of surprising beauty, and the pianoforte maintains its
      ground against its melodious rivals by means of its power of quicker
      motion. The whole work is clear and easy in each of its multitudinous
      details, and from beginning to end it is a true triumph of the art of
      recognising and adapting the peculiar euphonious quality of each
      instrument. This harmony of sound, combined with a somewhat strongly
      accentuated harmonic treatment, constitutes the principal charm of the
      work, which is not rich in thematic invention. Here and there Italian
      echoes are heard in the melodies, but the German style predominates, as it
      does in the quartets previously noticed.<a href="#linknote-330038"

      The greater number of these were composed between 1783 and 1786, when
      Mozart played much at concerts, and were intended for his own use; some of
      them also for that of others (Vol. II., p. 294).<a href="#linknote-330041"

      The concertos are a happy medium between too easy and too difficult; they
      are very brilliant, pleasing to the ear, without, of course, being empty.
      Here and there are places which appeal exclusively to connoisseurs, but
      even ignoramuses will be pleased with them without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain that he knew what he intended. Of the later concertos he
      writes (May 24, 1784):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot make a choice between the two concertos in B flat and D (450,
      451, K.). I consider them both tough morsels for the performers (<i>Concerte
      die schwitzen Machen</i>): but the one in B flat is more difficult than
      the one in D. I am very curious to hear which of the three concertos in B
      flat, D, and G major (453 K.) you and my sister like best; that in E flat
      does not belong to them, being quite peculiar of its kind, and written for
      a small rather than a large orchestra. So that we have only to do with the
      three concertos, and I am curious to find whether your opinion agrees with
      the universal one here, and with my own. They ought, it is true, to be
      heard with all the parts, and well played.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis which Mozart laid on the orchestra is very noticeable. The
      essential merit and originality of his concertos consists in his
      combination of the orchestra and the solo instrument into a whole, by
      means of the co-operation of all their separate and independent elements.<a
      href="#linknote-330042" name="linknoteref-330042" id="linknoteref-330042">
      42 </a> The prominence given to the orchestra (which, it must be
      remembered, owed to Mozart its richer composition, both of wind and
      stringed instruments) in those larger portions of the work where it occurs
      independent of the piano, as in the tutti of the ritornelli, gives a
      symphonic character to the concertos. Even in those places where the
      pianoforte asserts itself as the solo instrument the orchestra
      participates so directly in the course of the pianoforte part as to form a
      not disjointed whole; in fact, the concertos have been aptly designated as
      symphonies with a part for the pianoforte.<a href="#linknote-330043"
      name="linknoteref-330043" id="linknoteref-330043"> 43 </a> Mozart's art of

      tears from his old father at the hearing of one of his new pianoforte
      concertos, shows his delicate sense of euphony and accurate knowledge of
      instrumental effects. The pianoforte, with its comparative want of
      sustained tone, is at a disadvantage even with solo stringed or wind
      instruments, far more so with a combination of them. This was still more
      the case at that time, in consequence of the defective mechanism of the
      instrument; and both art and ingenuity were required to make it at all
      effective. When, after an elaborate ritomello, which has given a sense of
      fulness and satisfaction to the hearers, the pianoforte enters, Mozart
      aims at producing such a contrast, either by means of extreme simplicity
      or of a brilliant pianoforte passage, as shall gain over the listener to
      the peculiar charm of the new element, and excite his attention, which is
      then kept up by the competition of the rival forces. The composer has no
      intention of confining the orchestra within the narrow limits of a modest
      accompaniment (for in that case why should he have appointed it so
      fully?); he means it to put forth its whole strength, as well as to
      support and raise the pianoforte part. An inexhaustible succession of fine
      effects is thus produced. The delivery by the orchestra of the melody in
      sustained chords supports, as it were, the tendrils thrown out by the
      pianoforte, and gives a firm basis for figures and passages containing
      bold harmonic successions: But while it thus seems subservient to the solo
      instrument, the intensive strength and the tender fragrance of its sound
      effects are made to form an admirable contrast to the light and brilliant
      versatility, the sharpness, and clearness of the pianoforte. It seems
      scarcely necessary to illustrate by an example the universal
      characteristics of the species, but I may instance the wonderfully fine
      andante of the Concerto in C major (467 K.) Here the orchestral part is
      rich in striking harmonic detail, and in fine and original sound effects,
      which so completely enchant and satisfy the ear as scarcely to allow of a
      climax. In contrast to this we have a surprisingly simple pianoforte part,
      displaying the distinctive properties of the instrument without effort or
      difficulty, and hovering, as it were, like a higher spiritual element over
      the <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p472.png">[472]</a></span> orchestral
      accompaniment, with which it is nevertheless inseparably connected. Even
      Beethoven (who made a profound study of Mozart's pianoforte concertos)
      cannot be said to have surpassed him in this combination from within of
      different instrumental forces. The superiority of his great pianoforte
      concertos rests upon other grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed, however, that Mozart had no higher qualities than
      a finely cultivated sense for the blending of tone colours. The invention,
      elaboration and distribution of the motifs were governed by the nature of
      the resources at his command; these had to be taken into account in the
      first sketch of the work, that so justice might be done them in its
      completed form; the germ must contain the capacity for development under
      the most varied conditions. There is scarcely one instance in the
      concertos of an important motif confided to the orchestra or the
      pianoforte alone; they are all shared in common. But when a subject is
      broadly and elaborately treated by the orchestra, it is naturally kept in
      the background by the pianoforte, while other motifs, merely announced by
      the orchestra, are rendered with their full effect and embellishments by
      the solo instrument. This competition of the two forces is most evident in
      the alternating effects given to the working-out of the different
      subjects, but even in the brilliant figures and passages the orchestra
      appears like a well-proportioned edifice, decked with a profusion of
      arabesque-like ornament by the pianoforte. Thus the charm of these
      concertos, most rightly so called, depends upon the active co-operation of
      the contrasted elements, by means of which the whole work is richly and
      brilliantly grouped, as a picture is grouped by a judicious disposition of
      light and shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division of the concertos into three movements, as well as the
      formation of the movements after the analogy of the sonata, were found
      ready to hand, and only further developed by Mozart. The first and
      principal movement contains the essential ingredients of the sonata form,
      namely, a second well-defined subject, and the working-out division but it
      is freer, and, owing to its improved resources, more fully appointed. A
      distinct first part with a repetition does not <span class="side">PIANOFORTE
      CONCERTOS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p473.png">[473]</a></span>
      exist; in its place there appears the first ritornello, with the solo
      movement belonging to it. The principal subjects, with their working-out,
      are shared between the orchestra and the piano; but the solo is no mere
      repetition of the orchestral part; it differs both in the grouping and
      treatment of the subjects, and leads up to an inevitable climax. A short
      ritornello brings this section to a close, and introduces the working-out
      part, equally shared between the pianoforte and orchestra. The severer
      forms of counterpoint are only sparingly used, the harmonic element being
      the main support of an animated figure treatment; the polyphonic and
      homophonie manner are so blended throughout as to display the principal
      subjects from ever-varying points of view, and to keep the interest alive
      and active from first to last. This middle movement, on which as usual the
      main interest is concentrated, leads back to the principal key and the
      introductory ritornello. The latter is generally shortened, and the first
      part is not literally repeated, but undergoes modifications in arrangement
      and elaboration. The conclusion is formed by the customary cadenza, which
      might also be introduced at other pauses, but was invariable here. It gave
      opportunity for a free improvisation, consisting of brilliant passages
      wrought into a sort of capriccio with the addition of an elaborate
      variation on one of the subjects, or of several subjects so condensed as
      to form a <i>resume</i> of the whole movement.<a href="#linknote-330044"
      name="linknoteref-330044" id="linknoteref-330044"> 44 </a> The cadenza
      thus forms the concluding coda of the pianoforte part, and the orchestra
      brings the movement to an end in similar fashion by a more or less
      elaborate ritornello. In this way the first movements of the concertos are
      developed out of the general sonata form, with such a regard to the
      relative claims of the orchestra and the pianoforte as serves to
      distinguish them from corresponding movements of the quartet and the
      symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART'S PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p474.png">[474]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two other movements are altogether simpler in design and execution.
      The slow movement is in song-form, its working out sometimes that of a
      rondo, sometimes varied, but always simple and clear, and abounding in
      charming detail. Here again Mozart has displayed a fund of deep and noble
      sentiment in its purest form, and the fantastic and romantic elements,
      mingled with a dreamy resignation, and an earnest endeavour after the
      expression of individual feeling, are more apparent in these movements
      than in any other of his compositions. Startling harmonic progressions,
      scattered touches of piquancy contrasting with vague sentimentality, and
      rhythmical whimsicalities, give all the greater charm that they in no way
      interfere with simplicity of conception or purity of form. I need only
      adduce by way of illustration the simple and beautiful romanze of the
      Concerto in G major (453 K.), or the pleasing and highly original
      Siciliana of the Concerto in A major (488 K.). The andante of the C major
      concerto already mentioned is, however, incomparably the finest (467 K.).
      The emotion is so pure and lofty that the sorrowful impulses which prompt
      it, harshly expressed though they may be in places, such as the following&mdash;[See
      Page Image] <span class="side">PIANOFORTE CONCERTOS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p475.png">[475]</a></span> penetrate the
      music like memories of a long since vanquished grief that has no more
      power to trouble the pure serenity of a mind which has mounted from
      resignation to holy joy. This example, among many others, should teach us
      that beauty does not consist in the mere rejection of all that is harsh or
      keen, but in the maturity of the conception which gives birth to the work,
      and in the harmony of the conditions under which it is represented. Such
      fruits as these can only be offered by an artist who has discovered the
      true secret of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last movement of the concertos is always the easiest; it is generally
      in rondo form, sometimes in variations, lively and cheerful in tone; its
      predominant 2-4 time preserves its original character of a dance; or
      sometimes it is in 6-8 time, after the fashion of a hunting song, as in
      the rondo of the Concerto in B flat major (450 K.) which closes in a long
      crescendo with a regular hunting flourish of trumpets.<a
      href="#linknote-330045" name="linknoteref-330045" id="linknoteref-330045">
      45 </a> On the whole these last movements are more <span class="side">MOZART'S
      PIANOFORTE MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p476.png">[476]</a></span>
      interesting than those of the other pianoforte compositions, and full of
      graceful, even humorous, passages, of which the last movement of the C
      minor Concerto (491 K.) may serve as an illustration. The peculiar
      harmonic treatment gives the subject a character entirely its own, and a
      new transition at the close invests it with a surprising charm. The
      Concerto in D minor also (466 K.) confirms the oft-repeated observation
      that Mozart's compositions in the minor keys are his deepest and most
      important, for its last movement is distinguished above all others by its
      fire and intensity of expression.<a href="#linknote-330046"
      name="linknoteref-330046" id="linknoteref-330046"> 46 </a> On the other
      hand, the middle movements of these two symphonies (in E flat and B flat
      major), although not wanting in grace, are inferior to their other two
      movements in force and passion. It is true that the andante of the C minor
      symphony was encored cm its first performance (Vol. II., p. 288), but the
      effect it made depended not so much on its melodies, charming as they are,
      as on the obbligato treatment of the wind instruments, which was an entire
      novelty at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that Mozart's concertos afford the best standard for
      our judgment of him as a pianoforte composer. The majority of them,
      written for himself in his best days, take the highest rank among his
      works. The first three (413-415 K.) intended for large audiences are, as
      Mozart rightly indicates, light in character; so is the Concerto in E flat
      major (449 K.), written for FrÃ¤ulein Ployer, and the Concerto in B flat
      major, probably intended for Fraulein Paradies (456 K.); next to these may
      be placed the Concertos in D major (451 K.) and F major (459 K). They are
      all distinct in their main characteristics; some, such as those in B flat
      major (450 K.), G major (453 K.), A major (414, 488 K.), are cheerful and
      graceful; others, as the D minor (466 K.) and C minor (491 K.), are
      passionately agitated; others again, serious and self-contained, as the E
      flat major (452 K.)

      concerts and to have printed (Mus. Corresp., 1791, p. 362; 1792, p. 195).

      give anything like a comprehensive description of Mozart's wife, although
      I have received many communications from trustworthy persons who have
      known her personally. Their knowledge is of her later years only, and
      their accounts are often inconsistent. This inconsistency arises from the
      conflict in the widow's mind between pride in the fame of the husband, of
      whose greatness she was fully aware only after his death, and a painful
      remembrance of the hardships of their married life. These hardships she
      was inclined to ascribe solely to his want of capacity for practical
      affairs, and an injured feeling was often mingled with her unbounded pride
      in Mozart's artistic achievements and her belief in his love for her. The
      peculiarities of her second husband, Nissen, a business man, painfully
      accurate and precise, tended no doubt to intensify the contrast. Nissen's
      was an honourable, although a commonplace nature, and he had earned
      Constanze's gratitude by his care for her in her widowed and destitute
      condition, and by placing her in a good worldly position as his wife; so
      that it is not surprising that Mozart's memory should have passed into the
      background, with the exception of his musical fame, which Nissen could not
      rival. At any rate, we find Constanze continually posing as the patient
      martyr, suffering from the thoughtlessness of a man of genius, who
      remained a child to the end of his days. This is unjust to Mozart, but it
      would be equally unjust to Constanze to make her mainly responsible for
      the family difficulties.]

      misjudged in this respect is shown by such expressions as those in
      Schlichtegroirs Nekrolog: "In Vienna he married Constanze Weber, who made
      a good mother to his two children and a careful wife, striving to restrain
      his folly and extravagance. His income was considerable, but his excesses
      and want of economy in household affairs caused him to leave nothing to
      his family but the fame of his genius and the observation of the world."
      It is not surprising that Mozart's widow should have bought up a whole
      impression of this notice in 1794. Rochlitz warmly condemns such shameless
      calumny. Arnold is much coarser (Mozart's Geist, p. 65), accounting for
      his premature death by saying: "Besides this [excessive work] he was a
      husband, brought up two children, and had many intrigues with lively
      actresses and other women, which his wife good-naturedly overlooked. He
      must often have starved with his wife and children, if the threats of
      impatient creditors had been carried into effect. But when a few
      louis-d'or made their appearance the scene changed at once. All went
      merrily, Mozart got tipsy on champagne and tokay, spent freely, and in a
      few days was as badly off as ever. The liberties he took with his health
      are well known; how he used to drink champagne with Schikaneder all
      morning, and punch all night, and go to work again after midnight, without
      any thought of his bodily health."]

      Mozart was very accessible to the pleasures of society and friendship.
      "Among his friends he was as open as a child, and full of merriment, which
      found vent in the drollest tricks. His friends in Prague have a pleasant
      remembrance of the hours passed in his company, and are never weary of
      praising his good, innocent heart; when he was present, one forgot the
      artist in the man" (Cf. Rochlitz, A. M. Z., III., p. 494). His
      brother-in-law, Jos. Lange, remarked that Mozart was generally in most
      jesting mood when he was busy with some great work (Selbstbiogr., p.
      171).]

      with the original words, appeared at Vienna, with the title, "Mozarts

      the Concerto in F major (433 K.) is a rondo-like "Tempo di menuetto,"
      after the old style (Vol. I. p. 325), similar to one in a violin sonata
      (377 K.).]

      beginning of a rondo first intended for this concerto is prefixed to the
      Offenbach score of the Concerto in B flat major (450 K.). Mozart rightly
      gave the preference to the very dissimilar fiery theme of the present
      rondo.]
